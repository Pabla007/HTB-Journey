Multi/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shells. It's essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.

Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use:

1. Open Metasploit with `msfconsole`
2. Type `use multi/handler`, and press enter

We are now primed to start a multi/handler session. Let's take a look at the available options using the `options` command:

Let's do this by using the `exploit -j` command. This tells Metasploit to launch the module, running as a **j**ob in the background.

Notice that, because the multi/handler was originally backgrounded, we needed to use `sessions 1` to foreground it again. This worked as it was the only session running. Had there been other sessions active, we would have needed to use `sessions` to see all active sessions, then use `sessions <number>` to select the appropriate session to foreground. This number would also have been displayed in the line where the shell was opened (see "_Command Shell session **1** opened_").
