There's nothing promising in index.html

So if we are going to find any vulnerability than it's going to be here.

We have 2 filter in php upload file
in which the 1st condition checks if it's an image or not and 2nd condition checks if the extension is valid or not.

Allowed extension
```
$goodExts = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif"];
```


So we know where the file will get upload and how to bypass the filters so it's just matter of time we exploit it.
