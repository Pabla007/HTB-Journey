with the unquoted service path, all we need is one very small "wrapper" program that activates the netcat binary that weÂ _already have on the target._

Will install Mono to compile the binary
```
sudo apt install mono-devel
```

After the installation we have to open this file Wrapper.cs

```
using System;  
using System.Diagnostics;
```

These allow us to start new processes (i.e. execute netcat).

As i am feeling sleepy will start it tomorrow after the doctor's appointment
