The syntax for starting a netcat listener using Linux is this:

`nc -lvnp <port-number>`

- **-l** is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener
- **-v** is used to request a verbose output
- **-n** tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining this is outwith the scope of the room.
- **-p** indicates that the port specification will follow.


it's often a good idea to use a well-known port number (80, 443 or 53 being good choices) as this is more likely to get past outbound firewall rules on the target.
