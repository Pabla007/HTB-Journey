I refreshed the page and got this page

Tried uploading a normal jpeg and was successful in that

I already had a file ready for php regarding this but i have to use exif-tool this time so will be using this approach rather than using burpsuite and uploading the file.

There is an anti-virus running on the PC and we don't know which AV thomas is using.

So will not upload the shell and it will just run a command to check proof of concept that we can upload the the image or not.

exiftool -Comment="<?php echo \"<pre>Test Payload</pre>\"; die(); ?>" test-USERNAME.jpeg.php
