We have a reverse shell but but but we don't have full access to the system which means that Thomas done security works on this so we have to see how to escalate the privileges from here. Will try to run Winpeas but it might get picked up the AV.

Things to keep in mind:

```
powershell "get-acl -Path 'C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer' | format-list"
```
