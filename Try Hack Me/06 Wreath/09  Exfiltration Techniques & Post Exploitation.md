In a real world situation an attacker will be looking to exfiltrate data as quietly as possible as there may be an Intrusion Detection System active on the compromised network which would alert the network administrators to a breach should the data be detected. For this reason an attacker is unlikely to use protocols as simple as FTP, TFTP, SMB or HTTP; however, in an unmonitored network these are still good options for moving files around.

It's worth noting that most command and control (C2) frameworks come with options to quietly exfiltrate data

In short, the only limitation when it comes to exfiltration is your imagination
