### Netcat
Netcat is the traditional "Swiss Army Knife" of networking.


## Socat:
Socat is like netcat on steroids.


### Metasploit -- multi/handler
The `exploit/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells.

It's also the only way to interact with a _meterpreter_ shell, and is the easiest way to handle _staged_ payloads



### Reverse Shell vs Bind Shell
Reverse Shell means a `Victim Connects` To Us or a Target connects to us.

Bind Shell => Means we connect to the target.

| Reverse Shell | Attack Box     | Target        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
|               | Listening      | Connecting    |
|               |                |               |
| Bind Shell    | Attack Box     | Target        |
|               | Connecting<br> | Listening<br> |

`listener` 
This command is an alias unique to the attacking machine used for demonstrations, and is a shorthand way of typing `sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 443`, which will be covered in upcoming tasks. It will _not_ work on any other machine unless the alias has been configured locally.
