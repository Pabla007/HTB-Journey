### Netcat
Netcat is the traditional "Swiss Army Knife" of networking.


## Socat:
Socat is like netcat on steroids.


### Metasploit -- multi/handler
The `exploit/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells.

It's also the only way to interact with a _meterpreter_ shell, and is the easiest way to handle _staged_ payloads
