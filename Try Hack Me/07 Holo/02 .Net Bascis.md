- .NET uses a run-time environment known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR)
-  Use any .NET language (C#, PowerShell, etc.) to compile into the Common Intermediary Language (CIL).

.NET consists of two different branches with different purposes, outlined below.
- .NET Framework (Windows only)
- .NET Core (Cross-Compatible)

The main component of .NET is .NET assemblies. .NET assemblies are compiled .exes and .dlls that any .NET language can execute.

.NET Language → CIL/MSIL → CLR → machine code

Within .NET, there also exists the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). This concept is out of scope for this network; however, to learn more about it, check out this article, [](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview)

Visual Studio also allows us to manage packages and .NET versions without headache when building from a solution file.

To build and develop C# in Visual Studio, we recommend using the Windows development virtual machine,
