Now we have to maintain a foothold and to do that we have various option like adding a user or gaining a ssh and can login directly.

```
cat /etc/shadow 
```

So i was looking at the wrong place as you can see that we don't any hashes so i decided to go back and find my mistake.

```
cat /mnt/etc/shadow
```

```

```

So now we have the hashes and can crack them in the offline mode.

Now we have to identify the hash type and for that this site will help us
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes

And we can see a pattern from the above hash `$6$`

So it means we have to use mode 1800 to crack this hash which us sha512crypt and the good part is that will use google colab gpu to crack the hash.


This is the github link for that https://github.com/someshkar/colabcat
