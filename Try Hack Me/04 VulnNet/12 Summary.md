I don't know but i got pumped up everytime i see port SMB now not for MS17010 but there are many cool stuff we can do with it.

SMB -> Share -> Not authorize to see the share

redis-cl -> got the first flag with it but was not able to see the other flag due to permission deniend.

redis + crackmapexec -> told redis to connect with our responder and caught the hash using crackmapexec

hashcat -> to crack the hash into a password

got a username and password

SMB -> Share -> .ps1 file using it got a reverse shell

Reverse Shell -> Sharphound -> GPO Abuse 

SMB -> Got the flag
