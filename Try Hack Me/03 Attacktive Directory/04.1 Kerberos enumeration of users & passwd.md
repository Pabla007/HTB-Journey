Will install a tool call `Kerbrute`
go install github.com/ropnop/kerbrute@latest

Will use this tool to bruteforce and get the username and password

User & Password was given in the Challenge so will use it.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sq00ky/attacktive-directory-tools/master/userlist.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sq00ky/attacktive-directory-tools/master/passwordlist.txt

Will enumerate valid users using  `userenum`

Note we have to use the DNS_Domain_Name: spookysec.local and not just give the ip address
otherwise will get this error
![[Pasted image 20230913113316.png]]

So what i was doing wrong is that we have to specific the IP address of the DC along with the DNS name
```
kerbrute userenum -d spookysec.local --dc 10.10.212.247 user_list.txt
```

If want to use threads we can use this command
```
kerbrute userenum -d spookysec.local --dc 10.10.212.247 user_list.txt -t 100
```

Accounts that really stand out are or kind of looks juicy to meee :
svc-admin@spookysec.local
administrator@spookysec.local
backup@spookysec.local
Administrator@spookysec.local


>[! warning] It is **NOT** recommended to brute force credentials due to account lockout policies that we cannot enumerate on the domain controller.

But we will try and see what happens with the valid users in the hope that they don't use any Password Policy.
