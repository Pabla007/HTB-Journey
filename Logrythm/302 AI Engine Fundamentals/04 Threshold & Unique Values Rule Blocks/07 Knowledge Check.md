## Threshold Rule Blocks monitor for a threshold to be met.

Thresholds can be a series of identical logs or be represented by metadata fields of a _measurable_ value (e.g., ‘packets received’ or ‘amount’).

<hr>

## Unique Values Rule Blocks monitor for logs that are almost identical, apart from one metadata field

(e.g., ‘User Origin’ or ‘Host Origin’).


<hr>

## Threshold Rule Blocks contain time limit settings within the block itself, in which thresholds must be met

This is different from _Relationship_ time settings, which define the collective time frame between rule blocks. Threshold time limits should always end within relationship time limits.

A Unique Observed Use Case example was discussed.
