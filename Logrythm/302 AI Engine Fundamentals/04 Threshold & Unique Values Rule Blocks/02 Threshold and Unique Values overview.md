**The next few tiers of rule blocks offer increased capabilities in log activity detection:**

**Threshold Rule Blocks**
Threshold Rule Blocks monitor for a monitor for a **specific number of identical logs or specific log metadata values to be reached**. The criteria for the rule block is met when the threshold is crossed.


**Unique Values Rule Blocks**
Unique Values Rule Blocks monitor for **log messages that are almost identical, with the exception of one metadata field**. The condition for the rule block is met when the number of unique occurrences of this metadata field is met or crossed.


>[! bug ] There will be a common theme among the first 3 tiers of Rule Block Types: each will have options for Observed, Not Observed Compound, and Not Observed Scheduled.
