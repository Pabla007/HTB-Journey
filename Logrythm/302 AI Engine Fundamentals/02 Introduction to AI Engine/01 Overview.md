In this lesson, we will introduce the **AI Engine component** at a higher level before going into depth on the topic.


## Why does this matter?


**Advanced Intelligence Engine (AIE)** is what allows LogRhythm to examine and evaluate logs in real-time. Rule Blocks, built in the AI Engine, are what enable the AI Engine to evaluate and correlate multiple logs. 

The **AI Engine Rule Blocks** can be combined with each other to make compound rules capable of detecting sophisticated external attacks, internal threats, complex operational issues, and much more.



## What will I learn?


By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Define the functions of the Advanced Intelligence Engine (AIE).
- Explain how metadata flows to the AI Engine.
- Summarize the Rule Block types and requirements for each Rule Block.
- Recognize a compound rule and its requirements.
- State how AI Engine Rules generate Events and Alarms.
