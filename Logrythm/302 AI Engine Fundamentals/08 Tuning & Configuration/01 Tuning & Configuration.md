AI Engine Rules can be **tuned** and **corroborated** to improve the effectiveness of your system.


## Why does this matter?

- Tuning & configuring AI Engine Rules can help improve performance and reduce false positives.
- While one rule alone may capture some activity that warrants investigation, rules used in conjunction toward a more refined use case will establish the need for critical investigative efforts more effectively. 
- AI Engine can be a resource-intensive application and—as the development of additional use cases increases—it will become necessary to maximize the efficiency of AIE rules.
- Workloads provide a way to organize AI Engine Rules and manage resource consumption.


## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Reduce False Positives with Corroborated AI Engine Rules.
- Tune AI Engine Rules to ensure optimal performance of AIE rules.
- Utilize Workloads to further tune and improve performance.
