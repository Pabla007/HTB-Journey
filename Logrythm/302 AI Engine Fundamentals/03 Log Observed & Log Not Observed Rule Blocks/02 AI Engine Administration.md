## What can you do in the AI Engine Tab?

Administration Tasks Include: 

- **Creating**, **Cloning**, or **Editing** Rules
- **Enabling** or **Disabling** Rules
- **Importing** or **Exporting** Rules
- **Restarting** AI Engine Servers


## How can you add a new rule?

Right-clicking on the screen gives you the ability to perform many actions, **such as adding a new rule.**

- Use the **add button** or the right-click context menu in the **AI Engine tab** to create new AI Engine Rules. 
- AI Engine Rules resemble Alarm Rules in their structure; however, AI Engine rules can contain **complexities** that Alarms cannot.
- AI Engine Rules can be made up of **many rule blocks.** By combining up to three rule blocks, you can create an AI Engine Rule that becomes a powerful tool in monitoring for sophisticated threats, insider theft, complex operational issues, and more.

**After creating a new rule or modifying an existing rule, a service restart of AI Engine is required to place the rule into AIE memory.** 

**Merely selecting the "Restart AI Engine Servers" button does not restart the physical AIE Server or hardware the AIE is installed onto.
