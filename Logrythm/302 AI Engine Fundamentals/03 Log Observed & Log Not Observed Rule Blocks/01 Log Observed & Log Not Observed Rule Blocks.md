Using the AI Engine to detect and alert on log activity involves the creation of AI Engine Rules in the AI Engine Rule Wizard.



## Why does this matter?

LogRhythm has an Alarms feature where **activity contained within one log can generate an alarm** or notification to be received by an analyst. At times, this is all that is needed. AIE, however, does not carry this limitation – activity can span multiple logs of different types with varying metadata and timing. This provides increased capabilities to detect more complex log behavior.


## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Administer AI Engine and use the **AI Engine Rule Block Wizard** to create a Log Observed Rule.
- Configure **AI Engine rule blocks** and identify how rule block relationships function.
- Explain how _**Group By**_ **fields** are used in compound rules.
