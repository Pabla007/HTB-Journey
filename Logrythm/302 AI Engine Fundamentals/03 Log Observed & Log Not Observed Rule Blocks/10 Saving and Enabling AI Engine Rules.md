### Remember, whenever a rule has been modified or created, enabling your changes requires that the AI Engine Servers service be restarted.

This restart process will compile the new rule, insert it into the AI Engine, and allow the rule to run. 

- AI Engine Rules are disabled by default and must be manually enabled. 
- It typically takes the AI Engine 10-15 seconds to restart. During this time, the incoming Metadata logs are stored in cache.
- You can quickly restart the AI Engine services by using the button, located along the top of the AI Engine window.

Before AI Engine Rules can be used, they must be enabled, and the AI Engine service must be restarted. 

A Warning message, a message in the Restart column, as well as a change in the color of the Restart AI Engine Servers button, will indicate that a restart is required.
