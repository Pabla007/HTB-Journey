### **The AI Engine Rule Wizard is designed to assist you with the configuration of rules. As soon as you drop a Rule Block on the canvas, the Wizard is activated.** 

- You will use this Wizard when you choose to **clone**, **edit**, or **create new** AI Engine Rules.
- The Wizard allows access to the Rules' various configuration tabs, allowing for rule modifications, setting changes, and a summary of details.
- AI Engine automatically prevents the use of rule blocks that will not work together. For example, if a rule block requires the existence of another block prior to its use, it will be grayed out and cannot be dragged to the center.
