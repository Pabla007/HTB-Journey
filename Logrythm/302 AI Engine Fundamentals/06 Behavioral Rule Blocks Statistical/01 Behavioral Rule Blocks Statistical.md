**Statistical Rule Blocks** are another form of Behavioral Rule. Statistical Rule Blocks can compare real-time data in a log against a specified value, and can compare two different but related metadata fields.

## Why does this matter?

Statistical Rule Blocks are most helpful when you want to see two criteria happening at the exact same time (or very close to each other) but in a way that _wouldn't_ quite work for a compound rule.

In other words: **Statistical Rules are helpful when you want to see two different things happening, at the same time, but in a way that they wouldn't work as a Compound Rule.**


## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Use Statistical Rules.
- Use Profile and Monitor blocks with Group By fields.
- Create rules for advanced use cases.
