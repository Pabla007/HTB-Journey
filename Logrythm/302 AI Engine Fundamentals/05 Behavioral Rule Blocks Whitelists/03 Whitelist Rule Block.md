### Whitelist Rule Blocks establish approved activity and monitor for deviations.

The Whitelist Rule Block allows you to establish "normal" behavior from virtually any source due to the block's integration with the LogRhythm data filters. After learning what is normal, it compares that against what it sees in your live data. From there you can specify what is accepted or authorized. 

As a result, the block can be used for monitoring servers, applications, users, and network connections. Some use cases include:

Using the Whitelist Rule Block, you can monitor a user's activity on a network, server, or application. The Whitelist Profile Block will learn what kinds of activities a user performs, based on log information coming from, or related to, the target that is being profiled. Then you can review that information, modify it, and monitor for any activity that falls outside the established normal behavior.
