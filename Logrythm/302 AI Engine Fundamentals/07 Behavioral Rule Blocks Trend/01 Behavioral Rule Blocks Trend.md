**Trend Rule Blocks** are another form of Behavioral Rule. Trend Rules establish a rolling baseline of “normal” activity and monitor for variances against the norm.

## Why does this matter?

Trend Rules are helpful when you want a baseline to continuously update itself, but forget old information. 

By constantly learning and comparing, these rules are helpful in seeing spikes and drops in log data behavior.


## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Use Trend Rules.
- Use Profile and Monitor blocks with Group By fields.
- Create rules for advanced use cases.
