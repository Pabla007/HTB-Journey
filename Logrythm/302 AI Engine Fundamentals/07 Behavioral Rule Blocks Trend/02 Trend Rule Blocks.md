### **By constantly learning and comparing, these rules are helpful in seeing spikes and drops in log data behavior.**

Much like the Whitelist Rule Block, Trend Rule Blocks use a Profile-like learning mode to establish a baseline, and they require the configuration of a second Rule Block.

- Monitor Block- the current trend of incoming data is compared against the baseline data.
- **Baseline Block**Â - the Baseline Block is similar to the Whitelist's Profile Block. Both cylindrical blocks "learn" what is normal over a given period of time and then compares the live log data to what was normal.
