## What is a Use Case?

A use case is a set of actions or steps defining the interactions between threat actors, systems, or devices in order to achieve an objective.  
  
In other words, a use case is a **scenario that represents how events can take place by a threat actor to achieve a goal**.



## What is the most important consideration in use case development?

The most important aspect in use case creation is **matching the use case to your infrastructure**.  
  
If any gaps in log sources are identified, these can be addressed as part of the project or as part of a wider audit or gap analysis of the IT Security environment.



## What is LogRhythm ECHO?

LogRhythm ECHO is a standalone Windows application with web and command line interfaces. It **simulates a LogRhythm System Monitor Agent** and allows users to replay native raw logs and PCAPs into LogRhythm for **demonstration**, **validation**, and **verification** purposes.

## Key Takeaways

## A Use Case is a set of actions or steps defining the interactions between threat actors, systems, or devices in order to achieve an objective

In other words, a use case is a scenario that represents how events can take place by a threat actor to achieve a goal.

## In addition to identifying the scenario, use case creation involves...

...defining the flow of data, identifying events that indicate adverse conditions, determining alarms or notifications to create, establishing how SOC teams or analysts will respond, and defining what automated responses (or _SmartResponses_) to implement upon detection of an event.

## Several tools are available for testing use cases.

This includes (but is not limited to) MITRE Caldera, Red Canary Atomic Red Team Tools, and LogRhythm’s ECHO tool.

## System Monitor Agents should be configured for Least Privileged Access, which allows for improved security in remote collection of log data.

Examples of remote collection requirements under a Least Privileged configuration include full control of the installation directory path, read permissions to target directories or files, and membership in the Event Log Readers group in Active Directory.

## The testing process includes the following steps – Develop, Build, Deploy, Operate, Monitor, Feedback and Reiteration.

These steps follow a _Plan, Do, Check,_ and _Act_ methodology while including measures for feedback and improvement while testing.
