ECHO offers the ability to:

## Test
Test AI Engine (AIE) and Alarm rules that have been developed in order to **confirm that they will generate as expected** and that inputs to rules can be **reliably replicated**.


## Verify
**Verify** out-of-the-box AIE, Alarm, and Message Processing Engine (MPE) content, MPE rule regression, performance testing, and system load and stress testing.


## Demonstrate
**Demonstrate LogRhythm’s capabilities** to prospects, customers, partners, and system integrators.


## Author
**Seamlessly author new use cases** as needed to demonstrate or verify system behaviors (such as ransomware, financial fraud, and data exfiltration) that are specific to the target.

### The Testing Process

The testing process follows the standard methodology used in the Deming Cycle for continual improvement. The traditional Deming Cycle includes the phases Plan, Do, Check, and Act. This testing process has been slightly extended to include additional iterations to allow for continual feedback and improvement while testing.

Ideally, you would schedule a review of your AI Engine rules quarterly or bi-yearly and do this process of tuning and improvement at this point.
