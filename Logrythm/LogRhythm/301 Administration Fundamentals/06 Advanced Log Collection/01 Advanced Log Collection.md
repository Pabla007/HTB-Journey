## Why does this matter?

The topics in this lesson will illustrate the increasingly complex nature of collection configurations, providing the learner with the means to address varying log collection requirements, such as UDLA, API, and JSON log sources.



## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to understand and implement log collection methodologies for:

- **Universal Database Log Adapter (UDLA)** and **API log sources** – the next tier of log collection capability. 
- LogRhythm’s newest log collection technology, **Open Collector**. Open Collector allows for collecting from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) log sources, normally associated with cloud-based technologies.
