## Review Advanced Log Collection

System Monitor Agents are capable of collecting logs from UDLA (database) and API log sources, as well as from LogRhythm’s Open Collector (which focuses on the collection of cloud-based JSON log sources).

UDLA log collection involves the setting of database parameters and may also warrant troubleshooting techniques using connectivity tests and tools such as Netsh or Wireshark.

Depending on the log source, System Monitor Agents require specific configurations as a part of log collection.
