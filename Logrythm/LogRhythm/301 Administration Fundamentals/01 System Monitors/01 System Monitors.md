```
System Monitor Agents collect and deliver log data to the LogRhythm platform. No log data gets into LogRhythm without an Agent.
```


Log Sources send raw logs to the System Monitor Agent (Data Collector).


## Why does this matter?

Before LogRhythm can process data, the data must be collected by a System Monitor Agent.

To effectively utilize a System Monitor Agent's ability to collect logs from an environment, you must understand their features and functions.

For example: Windows vs. Linux installations, licensing capabilities, remote vs. local collection, and Agent location.



## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Describe the functions and features of a System Monitor Agent.
- Explain how to install an agent on Windows and Linux.
- License an Agent and list the different features of each license type.
- Explain the requirements of Local and Remote Log Collection.
- Illustrate how to use a central configuration policy to manage the setting of multiple Agents across your environment.
