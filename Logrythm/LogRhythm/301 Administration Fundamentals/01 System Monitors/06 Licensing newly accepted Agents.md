After accepting the Agent, a window will pop up.   
You'll need to need to **assign the Agent an available license**.   
Assign a license type that corresponds with expected log source types.


License Type
**System Monitors are licensed in one of three ways:** **Lite,** **Pro, or** **Collector**.  
  
By default, a System Monitor will be assigned a Pro license, although you can easily change that selection.

When installed, the LogRhythm System Monitor contains components for both a Lite and Pro license. A Pro licensed System Monitor can perform various advanced log integration or local host monitoring features that a Lite licensed System Monitor cannot. Note: You can change the license for a System Monitor at any time, thus unlocking or restricting the System Monitor features. 

Additionally, the Client Console now offers a System Monitor Collector License as an option during Agent acceptance. Collector Licenses are available through the Unified Licensing Program and offer the same functionality as that of the Pro license with the exception that Collector does not do the monitoring components as Pro.
