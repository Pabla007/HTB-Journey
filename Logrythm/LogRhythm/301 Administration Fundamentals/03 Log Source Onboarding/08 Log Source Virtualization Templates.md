Log Source Virtualization makes it possible to consume all the available intelligence within a single log stream that contains multiple records from different sources.
```


WHAT & WHY

Log Source Virtualization Templates are required for forwarded/aggregated log sources.

- If collecting from a source that contains different log sources, (e.g. Windows Event Forwarding, Syslog Relay, or Single Channel Source), a Log Source Virtualization template is required.Â 
- This helps ensure that the Log Messages from the varying log source types are processed correctly.
