```
Entities provide a way to organize two types of records: host records and network records.

- Host records define specific hosts that you know. 
- Network records define ranges of IP addresses.

## Why does this matter?

Entities, host records, and network records help you to:

- Organize and re-organize data.
- Assign visibility permission to Log Sources.
- Grant role-based permissions, so that people only have access to the minimum amount of data required to do their job.
- Establish traffic directionality.
- Adjust the priority and criticalityÂ of networks and hosts.


## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Identify how to arrange hosts and network records in a LogRhythm Environment.
- Describe how Network Record data enables identification of traffic direction.
- State Host and Network Record requirements and the reorganization process.
