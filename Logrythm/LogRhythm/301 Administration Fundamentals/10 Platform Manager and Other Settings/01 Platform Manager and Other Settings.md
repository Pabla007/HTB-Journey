The LogRhythm SIEM Platform includes the Platform Manager, a **centralized hub of platform-specific settings and options** for LogRhythm’s components, including access to the Knowledge Base Manager.


## Why does this matter ?

**Platform Manager settings** determine which logs are characterized as Events, as this applies accurate levels of importance to log data.

**The Knowledge Base Manager** provides a collection of out-of-the-box Alarms, AIE Rules, Lists, Reports, and other environment resources that will expand the capabilities of the SIEM. It is an important tool for keeping up to date with changes in LogRhythm’s modules.
