```
Once a time stamp has been displayed (though not necessarily a prerequisite), an Investigation or a Tail can be launched to examine how logs are being processed. Both are accessible within the Client Console and have their own buttons in the top bar.
```

## **Definition:** 

Investigations are the search mechanism within the Client Console and allow a search to be conducted against specific windows of time and various criteria, such as Classifications, Common Events, Log Sources, etc.

  
## **Location:**

Launch them from the Investigate button (located in the top bar of the Client Console), and an option to run a new or saved Investigation will be presented.

- Note: Saved Investigations provide a faster way of launching an investigation (by allowing you to preload search criteria).

## **Types of Investigations:**
  
Investigations offer a search option to specify the data repository to search against. Types include:

- **Platform Manager Search:** This type of search queries Events only. If a search should include Events and omit non-Events from the results, a search against the Platform Manager may be conducted.
- **Data Processor Search:** This type of search queries available Data Processors for any indexed logs, regardless of Event status. This search type is more common, as Event status does not play a factor and any logs of interest are returned.
- **LogMart Search:** This search option has been deprecated and is no longer recommended for searching.

**The following time specifications can be selected for an Investigation:**

- In the Last number of minutes, hours, days, or months
- Date is Before a specific date and time
- Date is After a specific date and time
- Date is Between two date and time selections
- Note: Selected dates and times do not guarantee log results. Results are dependent on log availability, based on Time-to-Live (TTL). For example, if a search is performed against the Data Processor but the selected date has surpassed the TTL of indexed data, search results will not be returned.
- **Log Sources to Query** offers the option to narrow a search scope to specific log sources. Narrowing the scope to applicable log sources only can reduce the time needed to return results. Available search query options include:
    - **All Available Log Sources:** Any registered log sources within the LogRhythm platform will be queried.
    - **Selected Log Source Lists:** A search will be performed against any selected log source lists, either created or made available from a Knowledge Base module import.
    - **Selected Log Sources:** A search will be performed against specifically selected log sources.



In the **Specify Event Selection window,** one or more metadata fields can be selected as part of the log search criteria. 

- For example, a Common Event of User Logon combined with a specific User (Origin) will perform a search for user logon activity generated by a user. 
- Metadata fields can be selected from the Add New Field Filter dropdown menu and clicking the Edit Values button will allow for defining populated values for selected metadata fields.

The last window of an Investigation presents the option to **save an Investigation for future use, launch an Investigation, or both.** If saved, name the investigation, and select read and write permissions from the available drop-down menus. To launch the investigation, click Next or Launch.

- Once launched, the Investigation will populate log results based on the search criteria and the availability of logs. It will display aggregate values within the Log/Event Analyzer tab, which allows for drilling down on groupings of logs.

**The Log Viewer tab** will display individual log messages and allows for filtering across populated metadata field columns. Double-clicking on a line item opens the Log Information window, displaying the raw log message and any metadata parsed by the MPE.
