```
Tails are like Investigations in that log results will be displayed in the same manner, with raw log message content and populated metadata fields.
```


- The difference is that a **Tail displays incoming log messages in real-time** and not by the same timeframe options as Investigations. 
- Tails are **often used to display the latest log messages as they come in; they continue to run and populate log data over time until they are closed.**


**A Tail may be launched in one of several ways:**

- Via the Tail Wizard, located in the top bar of the Client Console
- By selecting the Action checkbox of a log source in the Log Sources tab, right-clicking and navigating to check box on log source or log sources > right-click > Actions > Tail Log Source(s) 
- From the Search option within the Web Console

Note: More than one log source may be selected per Tail.
