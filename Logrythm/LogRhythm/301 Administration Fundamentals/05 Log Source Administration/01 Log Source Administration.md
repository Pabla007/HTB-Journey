Now that you've onboarded your log sources, you'll need to validate incoming information you receive from these, confirming log data is accessible, accurate, and readable.
```


##  Why does this matter?

Data is only useful if it is present and accurate. 

Therefore, knowing how to verify that logs are being collected where they should be and maintaining the timeliness and accuracy of log information is imperative.

Validation is an important step to be conducted **at the start of log collection.** It confirms that timely and accurate log information is available for reference later, if needed.



## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Use previously understood log source concepts when troubleshooting.
- Validate that a log source is collecting.
- Detect issues with log collection.
- Discover unidentified log sources.
