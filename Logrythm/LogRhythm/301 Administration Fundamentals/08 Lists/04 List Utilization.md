Lists can provide centralized management of grouped data that may change frequently, such as hosts or privileged users.
```


Lists are used by various features, such as data filters in the Dashboard, Investigator, or Tail tools. Lists are used by the System Report Packages when they produce compliance reports. **In fact, most system-installed Lists are directly related to compliance packages.**

For most non-administrative users, Lists provide an easy mechanism for selecting Log Sources when creating a custom Investigation (Search) or when creating a filter for generated reports. 

Analysts can choose a List designed for their use and be given the correct set of data automatically. As you manage Lists by adding or removing items, Analysts benefit; their investigations will pull current data at the time a List is referenced.

**List Options**

- Use Lists to filter data within Investigations, Alarms, AIE Rules, and Reports
- Use a SmartResponse to automatically update the contents of a List used in Alarms or AIE Rules
