Lists provide a way to centrally manage information that may be subject to change, such as a group of users or a group of hosts.
```

Lists provide a method for organizing assets and information stored in LogRhythm. They serve as logical containers, providing a convenient reference for functions such as **Reports, Alarms, Investigations, AIE Rules,** and **Tails**.

Lists allow you to group items by type; this allows analysts and other LogRhythm objects (such as Reports and Alarms) to quickly query or be assigned permissions to related data.

Various kinds of Lists are supported in LogRhythm, e.g. Log Source Lists that group together the various log feeds (such as Windows Event Logs or Syslogs). Other types of Lists include (but are not limited to) Users, Groups, Hosts, or MPE Rules.

Lists are also used to accept data from outside sources, such as third-party threat lists from Norse and Symantec. Lists can be integrated for use in AI Engine Rules and Alarms, as well as custom blacklists.

Lists are accessible to all users and can be created by any user. After the list is created, permissions can be configured to specify if the List can be edited by the owner, a group of users, or everyone.
