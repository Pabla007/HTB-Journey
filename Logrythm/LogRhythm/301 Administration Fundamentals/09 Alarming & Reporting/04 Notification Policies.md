To enable alerts of triggered alarms to designated recipients, a notification policy can be created and configured.

## Accessing alarm notification policies

In the Client Console: Tools → Distribution →  Notification and Collaboration


## Policy configuration

Notification Policies require a Policy Name and a set of configuration options that define how the Notifications will behave under the policy.


## Public or Private Policy

When the policy is created, you'll be asked if it should be public or private:

- Public policies can be used by others to modify their notification preferences. 
- A Private policy can be used only by the user who created it. Analysts can create their own private Notification Policies.


## Policy Options

- Policy Name
- Notification Email Subject
- Notification Period – a time window used to regulate the number of notifications received
- Maximum Notifications per Period
- Format (Text, HTML, etc.)
- Alarm fields to include and their ordering
