The LogRhythm SIEM Platform includes a **real-time alarming system** that can notify users when certain criteria are met.


### **We'll explore these topics in more detail in this lesson:** 

 - [ ] Alarms can generate from both **Alarm Rules** and **AIE (Advanced Intelligence Engine) Rules**.

 - [ ] Alarm Rules are limited to triggering from **one instance of a log**. (Complex log activity is reserved for AIE Rules.) 

 - [ ] **Not every log is an Event**, but a log that precedes or follows a security event may constitute log activity that warrants an alarm or notification.

 - [ ] **Notifications** are available for delivery to recipients on the triggering of a rule.
