The LogRhythm SIEM Platform includes a **real-time alarming system** that can notify users when certain criteria are met.


### **We'll explore these topics in more detail in this lesson:** 

 - [ ] Alarms can generate from both **Alarm Rules** and **AIE (Advanced Intelligence Engine) Rules**.

 - [ ] Alarm Rules are limited to triggering from **one instance of a log**. (Complex log activity is reserved for AIE Rules.) 

 - [ ] **Not every log is an Event**, but a log that precedes or follows a security event may constitute log activity that warrants an alarm or notification.

 - [ ] **Notifications** are available for delivery to recipients on the triggering of a rule.



### **The Structure of an Alarm Rule**

Alarm Rules are built on a series of metadata filters and log source criteria, with additional settings available for configuration. 

The properties of an Alarm Rule include a series of criteria and requirements captured in various tabs that, when met, trigger the alarm itself. Explore the tabs of an Alarm Rule in the graphic below to learn more about the specific functions of each:
