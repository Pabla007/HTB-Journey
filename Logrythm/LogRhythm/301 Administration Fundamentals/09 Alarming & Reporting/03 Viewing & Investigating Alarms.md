INSPECTOR PANEL

This metadata, or Event Data, summarizes criteria elements of the rule as well as the metadata values of the log(s) that caused the alarm to trigger. From the Inspector panel, Event Data such as Classification, Common Event, Host (Origin), and Direction, can be gathered and reviewed.



DRILLDOWN

This Event Data can help determine if further investigation or action is needed. If investigating further, clicking the Search button will open the alarmâ€™s applicable logs and bring them forward, allowing for deeper analysis of the triggering factors. This search for applicable logs from an alarm is called a drilldown and is available for all alarms.



LOG VIEWER

When the drilldown is performed, a search for the log(s) causing the alarm is conducted. When the search is complete, the log results are made available in the log viewer. This log viewer will list any populated metadata fields belonging to each log and include raw log information in a separate tab.
