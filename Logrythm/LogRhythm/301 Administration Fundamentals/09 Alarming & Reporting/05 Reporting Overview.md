ReportsÂ allow you to generate, export, and view data in a structured format.

### Report Templates

Templates are used to define the data and organizational layout of a report. They are editable at any time. Each template contains two columns that define the data contained and layout for the report:

-  The Fields Included column contains the list of metadata fields displayed in columns on the report. 

- The Field Grouping and Operations column determines how data is grouped by page section.

In this example, a PCI-DSS Log Volume Summary report is grouped by Entity at the top level, by Log Source Type at the sub-level, is organized in ascending order, and displays metadata and Log volumes statistics specified in the column headers.


## Template Layouts

If you are not seeing all the specified data columns in your report, review the layout of the report template. Report templates set to Portrait will display only up to six data columns. Report templates set to Landscape will display up to eight data columns.
