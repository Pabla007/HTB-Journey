To make it easier to run multiple reports, you can create a Report Package and schedule the run time for the package.

## Why Report Packages?
Report Packages are groups of reports. Packages enable the generation and delivery of multiple reports, making report generation easier when you need a large number of reports.


## For example...
A common practice is to create a Report Package when a set of reports should be delivered to intended recipients for review at the start of every week.


## Creating Report Packages
Depending on which Knowledge Base (KB) modules are available in your deployment, out-of-the-box packages may be available (especially if compliance-related modules are being utilized). Otherwise, Report Packages can be created from any available reports.
