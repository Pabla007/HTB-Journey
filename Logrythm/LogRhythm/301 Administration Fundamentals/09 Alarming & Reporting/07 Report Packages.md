To make it easier to run multiple reports, you can create a Report Package and schedule the run time for the package.

## Why Report Packages?
Report Packages are groups of reports. Packages enable the generation and delivery of multiple reports, making report generation easier when you need a large number of reports.


## For example...
A common practice is to create a Report Package when a set of reports should be delivered to intended recipients for review at the start of every week.


## Creating Report Packages
Depending on which Knowledge Base (KB) modules are available in your deployment, out-of-the-box packages may be available (especially if compliance-related modules are being utilized). Otherwise, Report Packages can be created from any available reports.

Explore the accordion tabs below to learn more about Scheduled Report Jobs.

## For example...

As an example, if a collection of security assessment reports were needed every Monday morning at 8AM and delivered to a group of recipients, a Scheduled Report Job can be created and configured to meet this requirement.


## Required for a Report Package

Scheduled Report Jobs require the existence of a Report Package. In the first window of a Scheduled Report Job creation, a package is requested before moving forward. Review Report Packages in the previous section above.


## Required to view in the Web Console

Only reports generated by a Scheduled Report Job are available in the Web Console. 

When included in a job, reports will be available for download in the Reports tab, either as a ZIP that includes all reports in the package or individually. By default, reports are available in the Web Console for 7 days, but this is adjustable.
