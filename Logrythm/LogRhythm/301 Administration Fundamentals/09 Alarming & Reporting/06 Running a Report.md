## ðŸ’¡ Running a Report as an Investigation

Running a report as an Investigation allows for live filtering of report data in order to focus on specific results. When run as an Investigation, the report will pass all its data filter settings and Log Source Criteria to the Investigate tool in real time, using data stored in the Data Indexer.

After the report has launched the Investigate tool, you can perform all the normal forensic activities against the data, such as filtering and sorting.
