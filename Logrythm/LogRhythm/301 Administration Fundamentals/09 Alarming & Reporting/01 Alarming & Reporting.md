After log information is delivered to LogRhythm, it may become necessary to be **alerted to the presence of log activity** and to **review log information after the fact**. Alarming and Reporting address these requirements.


## Why does this matter?

The **alarming function** alerts security personnel to potential threats or suspicious activities in real time, enabling them to take immediate action and mitigate potential risks to the organization's systems and data.

The **reports** function in LogRhythm SIEM is crucial for providing actionable insights, identifying potential threats, and facilitating effective incident response through comprehensive data analysis and visualization.


## What will I learn in this lesson?

In this module, we will review alarms and how alarm notifications are generated, as well as reporting and the areas involved in report creation and report delivery. 

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Identify when and how to use **simple alarm rules**, LogRhythm's **built-in diagnostic alarms**, and **alarm notifications**. 
- Recognize **r****eporting engine components** and where **out-of-the-box reports** come from.
- Describe how to create a **simple custom report** and how **investigations** can be used with reports.
