1. Safe: A call to an API that asks a question.
2. Unsafe: A call to an API that asks the server to change something. 
3. Idempotent: The data cannot be changed because the data is already the same as the call.

## Key Takeaways

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are simply a way for two different pieces of code or a human and code to interact with each other

## There are three types of calls to an API:

- **Safe calls** don't change data.
- **Unsafe calls** will change data.
- **Idempotent calls** are where the data cannot be changed as the data is already the same as the call.

## Structure of an API Call

- API endpoints
- API actions
- API parameters

LogRhythm’s APIs get new calls and functions with each release and changes to these APIs are ongoing.
