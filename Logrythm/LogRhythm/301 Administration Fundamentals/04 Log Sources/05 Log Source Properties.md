The first set of configurations for any new Log Source is contained in the Basic Configuration tab of the Log Message Source Properties window. 

This tab defines the Log Source Host (the server or device that contains the Log Source), Collection Agent, and Log Message Source Type. You may also edit the autogenerated Log Source Name and add a Brief Description to help other administrators understand the purpose of this Log Source.

> Flat File Settings Tab

The Flat File Settings Tab can help you adjust how to process each individual log.

A flat file is a plain text file. For flat file type Log Sources, the Flat File Settings tab allows you to define the location of the file or File Path, the Date Parsing Format, Multiline Log Message Settings, and Directory Collection options.

Flat File Settings are only available if an appropriate log source type is selected in the Basic Configurations tab. Otherwise, this section will show as grayed out.
