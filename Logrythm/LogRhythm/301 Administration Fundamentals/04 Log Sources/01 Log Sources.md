```
Log Sources generate the log files received by LogRhythm. They can span across many types of systems and are associated to Host Records in the Entity Structure.
```

##  Why does this matter?

Entities, host records, and network records help you to:

- Organize data.
- Assign visibility permission to Log Sources.
- Grant role-based permissions, so that people only have access to the minimum amount of data required to do their job.
- Adjust the priority and criticalityÂ of networks and hosts.


## What will I learn?

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Add a new log source.
- Configure its proprieties.
