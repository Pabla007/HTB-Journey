## What will I learn?

Upon completion of this lesson, you should be able to create and manage User Profiles, which directly determine the level of visibility to:

- Entities
- The objects within them (Host and Network Records), andÂ 
- Log source data originating from these objects

You will also be able to differentiate between Person and Role records, which grant login access to the LogRhythm platform.
