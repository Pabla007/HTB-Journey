Create a Case to track and document suspicious logs and alarms.


Before I continue my alarm qualification, I'm going to create a **Case**.  
Cases allow me to:
- Pull all the information I need into one place.
- Document the investigation.
- Communicate with my team.
- Derive patterns from our metrics.
- Meet compliance requirements.


## When Should You Create a Case?

Certain companies and organizations have compliance requirements. Their case structure may need to reflect this requirement, such as what information is put into the case or how to respond.

Here at Telectric, we use a risk-based approach to threats. We've decided to create a case for any alarm over 50.  
  
Since our alarm was 51, let's create a case.


<hr>


Though there are multiple ways of creating a case, at Telectric we create cases from alarms whenever possible.  
  
Doing this will auto-populate details into the case. It also will include the alarm card as evidence, allowing me to later close the card right from my case.

1. **Create Case From Alarm**  
    Let’s create a case from our alarm  
    -Click the middle cases icon in the top right corner of the alarm card.  
    -Then select "create case."  
      
    A pop-up window will appear. Here, we can customize the auto-populated information by clicking within any of the fields or dropdowns. 
2. **Customize Title**  
    -For example, I'm going to click and type my initials at the end of this case title, to make it clear to the rest of our team that I am the analyst on this case.  
    
3. **Confirm the Priority Level**  
    -I could also adjust the priority level by selecting the dropdown.  
      
    The priority level matters because it allows other analysts to see what I'm doing and whether I think it's important.  
      
    If something is a #1 priority, I should drop what I'm doing and work on this case.  
      
    -By our Telectric standards, a three fits, so we'll leave it as is.  
    
4. **Update Due Date**  
    For the due date, I actually want this case resolved today since this could be a serious data exfiltration attempt. I'll re-set the due date to today at the end of business.  
      
    -To do this, I click within the due date field and select today’s date from the calendar.  
    -Then, I select and delete the original time, and retype the one I want: 5 pm. 
5. **Summary**  
    The summary here is auto-populated.  
      
    What I want to say about summaries, is that you want to make sure they are detailed enough so that, if you came back to this case in two years, you could still understand and explain what was happening in this event.  
      
    In other words: write an explanation that "future you" (two years from now) could understand. Answer the question "why did you care about this at the time?"  
      
    -This description here fits what I need, so we'll leave it as it is.  
    
6. **Select Save**  
    -To finish creating our case, press the Save button.  
      
    Note, you may see the Cases tab automatically open on the left after saving. That's okay because we'll use it in just a minute.




## Be Thorough

You can add evidence to cases as you investigate.  

Always add as much information to a case as possible. This helps ensure a smooth transition between analysts and that all evidence is captured.


## Case Benefits, Even After Closing

Even after logs expire out of LogRhythm, they're always going to be available on this case, and cases are available until you expire them


## One-Stop-Shop

You can do drilldowns through cases. You also can share cases with anybody
