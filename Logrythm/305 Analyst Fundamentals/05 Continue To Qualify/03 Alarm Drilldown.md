Quick reminder: when an AI Engine rule is triggered as true:

- The AI Engine generates a new event that is sent to the Platform Manager. 
- It may also be set to trigger an alarm (that's what we saw on the Alarms page; an AI Engine rule was triggered as true when it was comparing metadata from logs being ingested).  

Let's drill into the Alarm card to see the log data that triggered this rule as true.


## Alarm Drilldown

1. **Click the Drilldown icon** on the upper-right side of the Alarm card. This will perform a drilldown and pull back the log data that triggered this rule as true.
2. **Then,** **click the "Completed: All Results" link** in the taskbar once the search results have fully loaded. 
3. **This will open the Analyze page.**
