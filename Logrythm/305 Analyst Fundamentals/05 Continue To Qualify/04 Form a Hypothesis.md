How do you know what to do next? Consider SOC team policies, form a hypothesis, and adapt to the situation as information is uncovered.

Now that I've completed my initial alarm drilldown, I need to decide my next steps: do I need to immediately raise the case to an incident, further qualify, start investigating, or close the case?


## How to Determine Incident Status

Sometimes it doesn't take much time qualifying before I realize I need to quickly upgrade a case to an incident and move the incident into mitigation and investigation.Â 

Refer to your SOC team's policy when determining incident status.

However, generally, an incident is:

- Something that has jeopardized the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information systems or the information the system stores.
- Sometimes something that has violated a security policy.
- Something that has impacted an organization that has been determined to need a response or recovery.
