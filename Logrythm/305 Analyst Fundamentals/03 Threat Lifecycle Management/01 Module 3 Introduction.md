## Threat Lifecycle Management (TLM) Overview
The Threat Lifecycle Management Framework provides a six-phase approach to addressing anomalous activity.


We use **Threat Lifecycle Management (TLM)** to reduce the time it takes to detect and respond to security risks. TLM is made up of six phases: **Collect, Discover, Qualify, Investigate, Neutralize, and Recover.**
