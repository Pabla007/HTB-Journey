What does "normal" user activity look like ?
Telectric is big enough that it would be impossible to know the typical behavior of every individual user.  
  
Instead, we create a baseline for "types" of users or user groups. For example, what is typical for someone in Finance, HR, IT, Sales, Support, etc.?

Start Small
Familiarize yourself with one user group representative, then scale up and adjust from there!

Understand Your Environment
Access and review key organizational information such as:

- Organizational charts to help you identify users and groups.
- Prior audits to help you identify applications used by particular people.
- A list of mapping tools (Firewall rules, Active Directory, etc.) to help you identify application stacks and network diagrams.
