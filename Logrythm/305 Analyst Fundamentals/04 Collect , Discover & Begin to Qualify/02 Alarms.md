## Alarms: a helpful discovery tool


WHERE DO ALARMS COME FROM
The LogRhythm platform includes a real-time alarming system that can notify users when certain criteria are met. 


HOW DO THEY WORK
Alarms announce the presence of log activity using created or existing **Alarm Rules** and can be configured to detect operational or security-related events or logs. 


ANALYST'S ROLE
Based on log activity or criteria being met, an alarm can trigger and either generate a viewable alarm within the console or a notification that is sent to designated recipients, or both.
