Add a tag to your case. This will help you categorize, organize, and analyze future cases.

Now that we created a case, let's add a tag to it.  

Adding tags now will help us in the future: if something like this happens again, analysts can run a search for all cases with this tag. This will allow them to evaluate related cases as a whole!


## Why Use Tags?

Tags are searchable, and allow us to look for: 
- Commonalities
- Trends
- Associated cases that may or may not be related 

In turn, tags allow us to dive deeper into those potentially more advanced or prevalent threats.


## Current Case Panel & Tagging

**Meaningful, Standardized Tags**
Tags should be meaningful to your organization and environment, and they should be standardized.

**Use a Common Language**
Using something like Mitre ATT&CK for Tags means that you have a common language that all Analysts are using.

Tags help analysts connect cases and spot trends, so they should be meaningful,  standardized across an organization, and consistent.
