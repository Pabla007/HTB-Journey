**Recovery is a crucial phase of TLM.** **It is all about improvement. How can we prevent similar situations? Respond faster? Be more efficient?**

HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE

**Reflect:** When closing a case, always ask yourself how you could have done it differently and more effectively.

**Revise:** Remember how we noticed that the Dropbox's URL didn't parse correctly? That is something we will need to improve.  

**Document:** Record your reflection and improvement ideas in the case comments.

QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK

**At the end of a case, I ask myself questions such as:**

1. Were there any steps that took longer than I expected? If so, why do you think that was the case?
2. Was there anything else that should've been done?
3. What are some proactive things we can do to position ourselves to respond faster and more comprehensively next time?
