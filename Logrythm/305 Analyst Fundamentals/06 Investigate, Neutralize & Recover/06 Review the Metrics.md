Know the numbers.** **Consider Case Metrics and Reports.
```


After closing our case, we can peek at case metrics and reporting to understand the numbers.

- In the end, our goal as a SOC team is to reduce the time it takes to discover and deal with concerning events.
- As a SOC manager, these numbers really interest me. I want to see certain numbers because I want to meet our service level agreements.

Therefore, it's good for you to understand the numbers.


## **Case Metrics**

Case Metrics show how long it took to understand what was going on and if something needed to be looked at. They also show how long it took to do that looking and close the case.


## For cases that ARE incidents, how would the metrics be different ?_?

**There would be different** **metrics****:** 
- Time to Detect (TTD)
- Time to Respond (TTR)

**There would be different milestones for those metrics:** 

- Milestones within Time to Detect:
    
    - Earliest Evidence in Case
    - Case Created 
    - Case Elevated to Incident
    
- Milestones within Time to Respond
    
    - Case Elevated to Incident
    - Incident Mitigated
    - Incident Closed


# **Reporting**

Reporting can be a recovery step. 

However:

- It is primarily used for setting baselines. 
- It is not what you would use for day-to-day work as an analyst.
- You can't run reports unless you have certain privileges. (As a Tier 1 SOC analyst, you might be given a report and asked to provide further context).

Therefore, we won't go into it too much right now.
