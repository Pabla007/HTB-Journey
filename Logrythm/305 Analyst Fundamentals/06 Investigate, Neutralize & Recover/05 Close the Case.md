We're almost done with our recovery steps!
1) Prevention
2) Brainstorming Improvements
3) Closing the Case
4) Reviewing Metrics


**When you're ready to close your case, don't forget to include detailed notes.**

Now that we've brainstormed ways we could improve our process for the future, let's add these reflections to our case by adding a note.

We will include as much information as possible in these comments because: 

- **Sometimes we're really busy and forget.** If we don't put all our thoughts into the case comments before we move to the next problem, we'll forget what would have been useful, which would mean forgetting what would ultimately save us time in the future!
- **We'll review to get the big picture.** Once a week our SOC team will do case wash-ups to review all our cases. We'll look at our metrics, the breakdown of how many types of cases we had, notice trends, and see what we can do to reduce those types of cases. 
    - For example, if we notice people pressing their mouse a lot on these things, we may recommend refresher training for clickers.


## **Add a Note**

Type the improvements we just brainstormed, as a note within the case.
