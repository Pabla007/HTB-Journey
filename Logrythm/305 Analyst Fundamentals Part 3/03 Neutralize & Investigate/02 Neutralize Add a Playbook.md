A Playbook is a list of steps that can be attached to a Case so that everyone knows what procedures to follow.

This is a very serious situation. Ransomware attacks can have widespread (and expensive) consequences.

Right now, instead of investigating further, we need to take action. Let's begin to neutralize the situation by:

- **E****scalating our case to incident status and u****pdating the case's priority level.**   
    While every organization has its own policy about when to escalate a case to an incident, most organizations consider a ransomware attack an incident. 
- **Adding a Ransomware Playbook**.   
    Playbooks are simply a set of steps that can be added to a Case from the Cases Page.


WHAT IS A PLAYBOOK?

For many types of security incidents, there are standard and consistent steps that must be taken by Analysts. **Playbooks provide a simple way to store, manage, and document procedures.** 

For example, if a user’s account is suspected to be compromised, a Suspected Account Compromise Playbook could be added. 

The Playbook would auto-populate a specific series of procedures (steps).

USING PLAYBOOKS

When viewing a Playbook, you can:

- **Pin the Playbook** to the top of the Case's Evidence section by clicking the pin icon.
- **Delete the Playbook** by clicking the trash can icon.
- **Expand the Playbook** to see the Playbook's procedures (steps). Do this by clicking the caret (arrow) next to the name of the Playbook. You'll see a more detailed view.
- Once a Playbook has been expanded, you can **expand each Playbook step** by clicking the caret (arrow) next to individual steps. This then allows you to:
    
    - **Assign a particular step to a user.** Select an assignee from the list. Only case owners and collaborators are available as assignees. This will cause the step to show up in the asignee's Procedure List Widget (see Raheema's Advice below).
    - **Adjust the due date of a step**. Click the pencil icon next to the date and click within the date and time fields to adjust as desired. 
    - **Add notes to a particular step.** Type a note in the Notes box.
    - **Skip a step**. Click Skip.
- **Complete a step**. Click the check box next to the procedure.

When all procedures in the Playbook are complete, the icon next to the Playbook name changes to a checkmark. You can see the progress of a Playbook by collapsing the Playbook and viewing its progress meter.

PROCEDURE LIST WIDGET
**The Procedures List widget allows you to monitor the completion of Playbook steps, and check whether any are assigned to you.**

It is pre-loaded on the Executive Dashboard, but can be added to other dashboards, as well as the Cases page.

Clicking a procedure in the list opens the Case Details view.

We escalated our Case to incident-status from the Case Card on the Cases Page.

However, a Case's status can be updated in **two** places:
- The Case Card on the Cases Page.
- **OR** The Case Card in the Current Case panel (you may need to click the caret next to the name of the current case, near the top, to actually see the case card).

Typically, I like to follow the Threat Lifecycle Management (TLM) Framework. 

However, in this case we jumped straight from Qualification to Neutralization. 

TLM is just a framework - often there are multiple ways to do things, and we need to be adaptable. For example - if we have a serious situation we might need to act fast, and ask the rest of our questions later. 

That's also why it is helpful to have Playbooks created for crisis situations!
