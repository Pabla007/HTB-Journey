Wildcard searches help you find variations on a search term.


**How big is the problem?**

Our next step is to determine how big of a problem we are dealing with. We will do that by performing a **wildcard search** on the process name. This should tell us if this ransomware process has run or is running on any devices other than Bob's laptop.


If you run a search using the term "Malware", your search results will display only exact matches. You will see data for Malware but not for Malware X, Malware Y, or Malware Z. To get a wider data set with **all logs** containing the word malware, you need to use a wildcard search.  

To run searches for all items containing a particular term, you need to include the prefix **sql:** and insert wildcard symbols **(%)** as appropriate. For example, if you wanted to run a keyword search for all users with "admin" somewhere in their account names, you would type **sql:%admin%** into the Search field.


That's great news! Now that we know only Bob's laptop was affected by the malware, we can move on to finishing with our Neutralize phase.
