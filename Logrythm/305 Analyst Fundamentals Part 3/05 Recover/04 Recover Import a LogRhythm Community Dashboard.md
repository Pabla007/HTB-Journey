## **Shareables on LogRhythm Community**

The Shareables section includes downloads related to SmartResponses, Dashboards, Playbooks, and Log Sources. We'll probably find a ransomware-specific resource there!



**Let’s download a shareable from LogRhythm Community.**

 Go to community.logrhythm.com and sign in with your username and password. Select Community from the available options.

 There is a lot to explore on Community, such as recent news, up-to-date product information, and discussion forums. But right now I want to check the Shareables section. Here we can download a variety of resources. Some are developed by LogRhythm, and some are contributed by customers and partners. I seem to recall that someone recently posted a Ransomware dashboard... 

  

Here it is! It looks like it was created by a LogRhythm employee, and was recently updated, so let’s give it a try. We can always customize or delete it if we don’t like it. Click the icon next to the file’s name to download it.

 **Now that the dashboard is downloaded, let’s import it to the Web Console.**

 In the upper-right side of the Web Console, click the Dashboard icon.  
Then click the plus button. From the bottom of the Inspector panel, click Upload. The Open dialog box will appear. Next, let’s find the dashboard file we want to upload. We can double-click it OR select it and click Open. 

  

Now the dashboard is uploaded into our dashboard menu.

 Finally, let’s verify that the name and permissions are acceptable for our company, and click save.  
  
I like how this dashboard shows many of the standard data fields, like Classification, Common Event, Users and Hosts. It should also help us catch ransomware since it has Object Name, Object, and Process Name widgets. These will help us see what files are being modified along with the process field.  
  
From here we could probably customize the dashboard some more, but why don’t we focus on that another day...

## Tactics

**Tactics represent the “why”** of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. **It is the adversary’s tactical goal**: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access.

## Techniques & Procedures

**Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action.** For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access.

**Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques.** For example, a procedure could be an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim. Procedures are categorized in ATT&CK as the observed in the wild use of techniques in the "Procedure Examples" section of technique pages.
