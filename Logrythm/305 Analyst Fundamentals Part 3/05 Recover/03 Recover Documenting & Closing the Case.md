Recovery depends heavily on documentation. It will be easier for you to be organized and ready for similar future events if you include your suggestions for improvement and a description of the case.

## **Step 1: Brainstorming Ideas for Improvement**

I was able to write my suggestions about how we may improve and function more efficiently in the future by heading to the **Cases** **page** and clicking **"Add Note."**


## Step 2: Close the Case + Add a Brief Summary

Follow along as I **resolve** **the case** and add in some **high-level notes.**


## **Step 3: Review Case Metrics**

Now that our case is closed, let's take a look at the Case Metrics. I am specifically interested in the Time to Detect (TTD) and Time to Respond (TTR).



## Time to Detect (TTD)

**Time to Detect (TTD**) is the time between the earliest evidence in the case and when the case was created.  
  
It is specific to cases that have been escalated to Incidents.
Note: Non-Incident cases have the same metric, though it is called Time to Qualify (TTQ).
