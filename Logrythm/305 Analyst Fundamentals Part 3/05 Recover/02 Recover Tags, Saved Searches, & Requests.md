Case Tags help keep us organized, while Saved Searches allow us to quickly re-run and re-use searches.


Now that we've mitigated the situation, let's start the recovery process, which involves cleaning-up, reporting, reviewing, and adapting. 

Our next two Playbook steps are to **update our case tag** and to **run a saved search** (to check whether our anti-malware software caught the process that was deleting files. If it did, maybe we can improve our alarming speed; if it didn't, we definitely want that adjusted).
