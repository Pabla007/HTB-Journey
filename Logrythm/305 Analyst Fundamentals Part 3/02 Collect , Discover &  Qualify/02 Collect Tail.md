Running a Tail allows you to track real-time and near-time logs and events.

One of the first things I like to do every day is verify log collection. If logs are not coming in correctly, that makes it difficult to identify anomalous activity.


We'll run a search on that log source using a tail. A tail is a search that updates in real-time; this should show us if the log source is reporting as it should.
