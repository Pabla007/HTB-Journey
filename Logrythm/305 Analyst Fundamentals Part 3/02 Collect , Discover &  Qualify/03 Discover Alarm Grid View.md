We can monitor for unusual behavior by scanning the Alarms page. The Alarm grid view allows us to do this rapidly and efficiently.

I'm frequently on the **Alarms page** looking for signs of anomalous activity. 

The Alarms page can be viewed in two different ways:
- Alarm card view 
- Alarm grid view

Though I personally prefer using the Alarm grid view, switching between the two is easy. Just click "Grid" on the upper right of the screen.
