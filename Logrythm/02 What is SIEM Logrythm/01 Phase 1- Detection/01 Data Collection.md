It is crucial to collect data from everything connected to your environment including your network, servers, applications, and endpoints.

Centralizing Data Collection is very critical.

- **Data Collection**
- **Detection**

## **What's 'log' got to do with it?**

Log messages are those motion records generated by log sources in your environment. A **log source** is any system (application, device, etc) that can communicate with the network and provides log messages (data).

A **log message** (log) is a record of activity on a network. A log may include a user logon, system shutdown, application installation, authentication failure, and more. Like the home security motion records, all logs are recorded but they are not all important.

>[! important] Where do logs come from?

Each log source in your environment generates logs specific to its functions. Data Collection is the process of collecting raw log messages from log sources.

## **Detection & Data Collection**

**Detection** is all about using the SIEM to detect a problem in your environment. When the SIEM is constantly collecting raw log message data from log sources, it is able to instantly catch any problem that arises on a specific log source. Without Data Collection there is no detection.
