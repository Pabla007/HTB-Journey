An organization cannot meet compliance requirements without Reporting. Simple as that.

> Key Terms in this lesson:
- **Reporting**
- **Analysis**


## What is a report?

A **report** is a summary of log source activity based on a set of criteria.

A report is created for one of two reasons:

1. **Compliance & Audits**: Depending on the industry (healthcare, banking, etc.), compliance standards require certain information to be included in reports. Compliance reporting is used to satisfy an audit.
2. **Internal Optimization**: An internal report can be created for the types of cases being raised and time to resolve. Historical reporting allows a SOC Analyst to determine trends of cases and threats to the organization, and optimize internal processes.



## **Analysis & Reporting**

As **analysis** of a problem occurs, documentation of that analysis is critical. **Reporting** is about documentation: it is a requirement to pass an audit and remain compliant, and internal reporting can help a team to optimize its overall security operations.
