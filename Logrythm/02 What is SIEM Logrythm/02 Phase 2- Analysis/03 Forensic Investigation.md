If you look at an event today, it is security. If you look at it tomorrow, it is forensics. 

Preservation of today's data makes it possible to use it for Forensic Investigation tomorrow.

> Key Terms in this lesson:
- **Forensic Investigation**
- **Analysis**


## **What is forensic data in this context?** 

In the context of cybersecurity, the preservation of forensic data in a **Forensic Investigation** is critical. Manipulating, changing, or rewriting data compromises the integrity of the investigation.


## **Forensically Sound SIEM Data Storage Principles**

The SIEM stores data using forensically sound principles via archiving and data aggregation. Forensically sound data allows for the production of reliable electronic evidence before a court of law.


**The 4 Forensically Sound SIEM Data Storage Principles:**

 - Archives : Copies of unmodified logs with accurate timestamps.
-  Storage Integrity : Tamper-proof and secured using hashes.
-  Accuracy : Collects relevant data across all systems to ensure fidelity across sources.
- Retention : Indefinite data storage and ability to retrieve that data at any time.

## **Analysis & Forensic Investigation**

**Forensic Investigation** is the phase of **analysis** where the Analyst becomes the detective. An attacker can modify endpoint logs or server logs, but a SIEM is the final bastion of truth. It holds historical and current data, and log messages that can be used to reliably replay what occurred in an attack. These capabilities are important to an investigation and hold up in a court of law.
