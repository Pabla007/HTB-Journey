Taking the time to pause and brainstorm in the Recover phase is important so we can be more efficient in the future.

- First, we'll add Irene to a Repeat Offender List (ROL)
- Then we'll add illegalstreemingbuddy.com to our block list


**We can also use 3rd party contextualize actions to help us gather more information, faster, for when we investigate similar cases in the future.**


During the Investigation stage, we used **whois** to find out "who is" the owner of the IP address behind the site Irene was streaming on. Our answer: Amazon Web Services (AWS). That was a good first step but...

**Did you know that there are additional steps that allow us to add new items to our 3rd party contextualize search?** 

For example, we could have gone to LogRhythm's Community Website and searched for "Contextualized Action Configurations" and added VirusTotal or Ultimate Windows Security to the Contextualize Actions in the Web Console. This would have allowed us to run a search for even more specifics behind illegalstreemingbuddy.com, such as determining whether or not this site has a bad reputation and posed a risk of malware.

This is a very powerful feature, and thinking back, we could have taken advantage of this.
