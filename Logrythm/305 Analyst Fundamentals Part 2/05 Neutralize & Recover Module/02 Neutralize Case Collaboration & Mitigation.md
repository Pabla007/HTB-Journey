Sometimes we need to bring others onto our case. Adding case collaborators and case owners allows your team to work seamlessly.

PIN THE REPORT
  
To pin a report:  
1. In the **Current Case pane**l, hover your cursor over the piece of evidence that you want to pin and a **Gear** **icon** will appear.
2. Click the **Gear icon**.
3. Click the **Pin icon**.


ADD A CASE COLLABORATOR

**To add a case collaborator:**
1. Open the case details view of the relevant case.
    
2. In the **Collaborators panel** on the right, click in the **Add Collaborator** field towards the bottom.  
    A list box of available individual users and groups appears above the Add Collaborator field. Groups appear at the top of the list, followed by individual users.
    
3. Click a user or a group from the list.  
    To narrow the list, start typing the name of the user or group that you are seeking.


## Case Collaborator vs. Case Owner

Only the owner can change the status of the case. A collaborator can't move the case from open to incident status, incident to mitigated to resolved. Otherwise, there is no other difference in the functionality.


## Reasons For Adding Collaborators

- To escalate the situation to someone higher up.
- To make sure work on the case can continue after your shift ends.
- Another Analyst is working on a similar case.

## An Analyst's Role in Reports

While it's up to our LogRhythm Admin to produce the reports, it's the Analyst's job to communicate the necessary information needed within the report. 

**C****onsider the purpose of a report**: Which metadata fields should be included?
  
For Irene's case:

- I wanted the report to show all of her browsing histories for the last 30 days.
- Irene should be the first filter and the URL she went to the second.  
- I only wanted this report to include the following metadata fields: Date, URL, IP Origin, & IP Impacted.

## Document Report Requests

It's always a good idea to document your request for your Manager or Administrator to run a report in the notes section.


## Review the Report

Review the report once it's complete to verify it shows the correct information.
