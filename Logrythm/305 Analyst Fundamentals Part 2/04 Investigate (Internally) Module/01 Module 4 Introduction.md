## TWO WAYS TO PIVOT

**There are two ways you can run a pivot search**
- From a TopX widget 
- From the Analyzer grid (demonstrated above)


**A pivot search from a TopX widget on a Dashboard:**
- Defaults to the current time and date
- Only allows you to search the exact value shown in the widget


**A pivot search from the Analyzer grid:**

- Defaults to the log's date and time
- Displays results for all metadata that go into the fields Host and Application
    - Host has the values Known Host, Hostname, and IP Address
    - Application has the values Known Application, TCP/UDP port, and Protocol

HOW TO PIVOT FROM A WIDGET

**To pivot from a TopX widget in a dashboard:** 

1. Hover your mouse over the widget, so that the Gear icon appears.
2. Click the Gear icon.
    - A blue border appears around the widget and the Inspector panel opens on the right.
3. Click the label or the chart element that represents the metadata you want to pivot against.
    
    - **Be sure to only click once.** (Double-clicking initiates a drilldown search).
        
4. Narrow your search to a specific time frame by typing in the **hh** and **mm** fields.
    
5. If the search criteria is sufficient, click Search Now.



ADVANCED PIVOT SEARCHES
**If you want to add search criteria or adjust more than just the time of your pivot search:**

1.  Click **+ Add to Search** (instead of simply clicking Search Now).
    - A search task will float towards the Search button on the upper menu bar.
    - A blue oval will appear next to the button indicating that a search value has been added.

1. Add and adjust your search criteria, just as you would for any traditional search.
