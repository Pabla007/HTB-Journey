Sometimes a little qualification is necessary before creating a case.That way, you know the data in your dashboards is worth documenting.
```

Because I'm still not 100% sure what we're seeing, let's qualify the current situation a little more before creating a case. Let's drill into the suspicious URL in our custom dashboard.

## Option 1: Continue to Qualify

**Try Again.**  
  
While we could continue to qualify, it is important that we create a case so we can document what we found. Otherwise, an important detail could get lost, or work could accidentally be duplicated.    
  
Instead, I recommend that we create a case next (click the other tab to see this in action).


## Option 2: Create a Case

**Correct!** We've qualified this case enough to know that we want to investigate deeper into it. It makes sense to create a case now, so that we can document our findings as we go.  
  
After reviewing all the logs:

- Select **Check all** from the Analyzer grid's Actions column
- From the Select dropdown, choose **"Create New Case and Add Logs"**
- Title the case, confirm the priority and due date, and add a description to the logs. 
- Select **Save** to create the case.
