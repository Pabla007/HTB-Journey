3rd Party Contextualize Action search tools help enhance investigations.

**Whois**, **Traceroute**, and **Ping** are the 3rd party search tools that are pre-built into the LogRhythm Web Console for Contextualize Action searches. Contextualize Actions provide a quick way to access useful outside data sources with the click of a button (without having to leave the Web Console!). 

Have a favorite 3rd party tool you want to add to the Web Console? You can configure additional contextualize actions as well. We will be sharing more about that in 305 Analyst Fundamentals part 3. For now, let's see what you know about these three tools that are already included, then we will go over how to use them within the LogRhythm Web Console.

Now we know that illegalstreemingbuddy.com is coming from Amazon Web Services. We weren't able to find any further information about its origins, so it's possible that this isn't just a compliance issue. Has Northam Bank also been exposed to possible bad actors?

We need to continue our investigation to see what else we can find.
