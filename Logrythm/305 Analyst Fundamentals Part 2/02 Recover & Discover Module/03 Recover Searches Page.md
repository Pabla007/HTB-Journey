## Update a Saved Search

We want to be aware of any unsafe sites being used at Northam Bank. This includes potentially malicious streaming sites such as FakeFileShare.com, which was used in yesterday's streaming case.  
  
Previously, I created a saved search that includes these unsafe sites. Saved searches are great because they give us quick access to routine searches. Plus they're shareable!  
  
Let's add FakeFileShare.com to my saved search.
