DRILL INTO NODE-LINK GRAPH
In the Web Console, click on the **+** sign in the top left corner of the Node-Link graph widget to drill into it and see the names of the users and hosts within. Users are circles and hosts are squares. 

The numbers on the connecting lines show the number of connections between two nodes during the timeframe you are examining.



USER INSIGHT
By hovering over a user node, you can gain even more insight.


HOST DETAILS
You can do the same with host nodes. By hovering over one, you can get more detailed information about activity involving that host.


COLOR CODING
You may have noticed that some of the lines were different colors. This is another way to customize the widget to work best for you. In the widget settings, you can choose how to use color-coding in the node-link widget so that you can easily see whatever you think it is most important to call attention to.
