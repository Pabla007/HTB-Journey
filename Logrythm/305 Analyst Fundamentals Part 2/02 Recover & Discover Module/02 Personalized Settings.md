## Prefer to see Bjorn's steps as a list ?_?

**Open User Settings Menu**
- **First:** Click on the user icon to get to the Settings button.
- **Next:** Click on the Settings button to open the User Settings menu.


**User Settings Menu**
- **Display:** Change the colors on the screen from Day mode to Night mode. 
- **Drilldown:** Determine if drilldown information is displayed in a new browser tab or in the same page. 
- **Password:** Changing your password here will also update it in the Client Console. If you are logging on with your "normal network credentials" then it will change your Domain Account Password, so you must be very careful. We DO NOT recommend changing your Network Account password here.  
- **Date Time Format:** Change how the date is displayed. 
- **Navigation Warning:** Change whether you are warned about going to links outside of the LogRhythm Web Console i.e. internet-based URLs. 
- **Query Locations:** Setting the default location for searches here will also change the Default Repository setting in the Client Console.
