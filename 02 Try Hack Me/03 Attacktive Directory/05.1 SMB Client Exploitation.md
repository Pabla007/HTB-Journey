Now will see if we can get anything related to smb share with user svc-admin this time as we got the passwd

User: svc-admin
Passwd : management2005

```
smbclient -L 10.10.180.141 -U 'svc-admin'
```

So have done this much work to get this share in the 1st place hahah cuz if we get it simply that it wouldn't be this much fun.

Will now will connect with Share-name `backup`

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.180.141\\backup -U 'svc-admin'
```

This is the base64 data in the backup file
```
YmFja3VwQHNwb29reXNlYy5sb2NhbDpiYWNrdXAyNTE3ODYw
```

Will use a site called **CyberChef**

backup@spookysec.local:backup2517860
SOoooooooooooooooooo We get another user and passwd
User: backup
Passwd : backup2517860

or if want to use inbuilt function in linux
![[Pasted image 20230914175728.png]]
echo "YmFja3VwQHNwb29reXNlYy5sb2NhbDpiYWNrdXAyNTE3ODYw" | base64 --decode 
or 
base64 -d base64.txt > base64_original.txt
