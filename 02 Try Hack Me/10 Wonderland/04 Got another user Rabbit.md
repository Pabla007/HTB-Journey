Let's run the linpeas again as i have seem something with root and hatter permission

Now i think the usr txt is in the tryhackme folder and we already have the root.txt in alice but don't have the priv to see the content.

Let's say where this journey take us.

There is something related to perl we got this earlier as well but was not able to run but i think now we can escalate.
```
/usr/bin/perl = cap_setuid+ep

/usr/bin/perl5.26.1 = cap_setuid+ep

/home/hatter/.bash_history
```

I told that i was not able to recall the permission but here we have hater.
let's open GTFOBINS and see what we can do

```
perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh";'
```
With little tweaks in the command we got something

I was wrong and the user.txt was in the root folder
```
thm{"Curiouser and curiouser!"}
```
![[Pasted image 20231102144416.png]]

Let's read the root file we already know where it is
```
thm{Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what youâ€™re at!}
