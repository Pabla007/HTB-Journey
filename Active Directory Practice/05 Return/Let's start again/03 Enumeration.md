```
enum4linux -a 10.10.11.108
```

```
Domain Name: RETURN               
Domain Sid: S-1-5-21-3750359090-2939318659-876128439
```


Will run the above command again and see if we can have any change in the information
```
enum4linux -a 10.10.11.108 -u svc-printer -p '1edFg43012!!'
```
no change in the information i was just trying so we have to wait for the nmap so will idea which port and services to target.
