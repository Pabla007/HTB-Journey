However even if a file share doesnâ€™t contain any data that could be used to connect to other systems but it is configured with write permissions for unauthenticated users then it is possible to obtain passwords hashes of domain users or Meterpreter shells.
```
smb-share-scf-file attacks
```


Keep in mind that we have to turn SMB and HTTP on in order to get the hashes
```
responder -I tun0
```
Will put the scf file in the smb share that has the write permission

Let's crack the hash using hashcat
