### Bhoot time hogaya I haven't written anything for anyone for so Long. (Beware ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Haasiyoo Naaa Kudiyee !!)

I wasn't joking when I told that I won't call Uuu on ur Birthday. 

>[! Bug] How could I have known it's your Janam Din !_!

If you haven't become "Older"

It all started with a `Pick-up` Line and from that day till today I will say that kudi 👧
is 💢`Jhali` that's for sure. Almost 4 years have passed we talk whenever we get time.

<hr>


>[! question] I still think sometimes why this kudi even talk with me ?

Bhoot `Mintaa` karniyaa pendiyaa kudi nu song send kardooo kardooooo and busy kudi apne kimati samaye tu send vhi kardendi a. .I tease her and tell her whatever comes to my mind without filter (i.e. she might get angry some time sorry for it 🙇). 

<hr>


>[! important] Kudi

I will keep things short. Kudi is trying atleast what I have seen. Looking for jobs , doing house related works seeing after her parents (i.e. Thoda leehza kaat hega) but I think it's the love ❤️ language she might be using with her parents (i.e.Taang kardi a kudi but unaa pyaar vhi kardi aa) don't know she tell that to their parents or not if not that atleast ek hug karke boldiyooo (i.e. DO THIS TASK)

<hr>


>[! warning] Ending

In the end I will say IF i say I am busy means I might be doing some other persons work. Work load gets high when people pending task getting loaded. So it's me I help the people I love but I try to msg/call whenever possible. So don't think I am ghosting someone I might be helping someone at that time. 

So Jhali / Pagal / James Bond wali Budi / Buggi / kudi has a GOOD heart but thode swear words kaat karoo this I will say for sure. Hope u had a wonderfull birthday and I had done the Ardaas but i will suggest u to do that yourself.  

Get Outtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
