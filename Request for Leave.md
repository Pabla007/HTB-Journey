Subject: Request for Salary Review and Transition to Offensive Team

Dear Sir,

With only one month left until I complete my 1st year with the organization, I would like to express my gratitude for the immense learning opportunities and the support I've received from the team. I am eager to continue growing, delivering high-quality work, and contributing meaningfully.

As I approach this milestone, I would like to make a formal request for a salary review and to discuss my transition to the offensive team. Given the rising living expenses in metro areas, it has become increasingly challenging to manage on my current compensation. Considering these figures and the financial demands of living in a metropolitan city, I am hopeful for an adjustment in my salary to better align with these costs.

Additionally, I understand that my initial compensation was structured to assess my performance and evaluate whether I possessed the necessary skills for the role. I hope that my dedication, the quality of my work, and my commitment to continuously improving have demonstrated my value to the organization.

Request:
- A clear timeline (month and date) for when I can switch to the offensive team.
- A revised salary offer that takes into account metro city living expenses, with an expected CTC of at least â‚¹6 lakhs.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am open to discussing any details and am confident that we can find a solution that reflects both my experience and the financial realities of living in a metro area.

Best regards,  
Simranjit Singh Pabla
