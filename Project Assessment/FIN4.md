FIN4 knows their targets. Their spearphishing themes appear to be written by native English speakers familiar with both investment terminology and the inner workings of public companies.

FIN4 does not infect their victims with malware, but instead focuses on capturing
usernames and passwords to victims’ email accounts, allowing them to view private
email correspondence.

FIN4 uses their knowledge to craft convincing phishing lures, most often sent from other victims’ email accounts and through hijacked email threads.

However one fact remains clear: access to insider information that could make or break stock prices for dozens of publicly traded companies could surely put FIN4 at a considerable trading advantage

The group frequently employs M&A-themed and SEC-themed lures with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros implemented to steal the usernames and passwords of these key individuals

FIN4 has included links to fake Outlook Web App (OWA) login pages designed to capture the user’s credentials.

In one case, FIN4 targeted employees involved in Medicaid rebates and government purchasing processes - these issues can heavily influence stock prices. Healthcare and pharmaceutical companies depend heavily on the decisions of large third party
payers (like Medicaid) whose purchasing power and rebate decisions can make or break a company’s earnings.

FIN4’s emails would be incredibly difficult to distinguish from a legitimate email sent
from a previously compromised victim’s email account.

However the scale of FIN4’s operations, with targets at more than 100 public companies, coupled with their tactic of going after key individuals’ emails, sets this group apart
