```
I leave for work in the morning and locking my front door is a security control that i use to keep bad things out.

But let's say i accidently left my back window open.

Contrart to what most people believe the window being open is not a threat, this is a vulnerablitiy (i.e. it's a gap in my home system)

But just a window is open doesn't mean there's a breach just yet.
Exploits the gap in order to make this an issue. 

The outcome of actions taken by the person or a thing whether it's a burglar or a rogue snake that slithers through the window, that is what is considered the threat.

What this means in practice is that you have to know the ins and outs of the company you are trying to protect.
- Be familiar with the technology environment, the people, the processes, and all of the assets that make the company run, and then by the phrase know your enemy, it means that 
- you also need to know the threats you face.
- Who is out to get you and why ?_?
