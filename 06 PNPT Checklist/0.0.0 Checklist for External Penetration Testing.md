### **1. Pre-Engagement Phase**

- [ ]  **Review Rules of Engagement (RoE):** Confirm scope, timelines, and client expectations.
- [ ]  **Confirm IP Ownership:** Ensure all IPs in scope belong to the client.

---

### **2. Reconnaissance (OSINT)**

- [ ]  **Gather Public Information:** Use OSINT to identify the organization’s structure, employees, and technologies in use.
- [ ]  **Email Discovery:** Find known email addresses or formats (e.g., `<first>.<last>@company.com`).
- [ ]  **Breached Database Searches:** Use tools like **DeHashed** to discover leaked passwords or other sensitive information.
- [ ]  **Review Social Media/Job Postings:** Identify potential targets and tools/technologies mentioned in public profiles.
- [ ]  **Code Repository Search:** Look for sensitive information in public GitHub or other code repositories.
- [ ]  **Cloud Storage Enumeration:** Search for open S3 buckets or similar storage.

---

### **3. Scanning & Enumeration**

- [ ]  **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    - Run scans on IPs in scope using tools like **Nmap**, **Nessus**, or **OpenVAS**.
    - Prioritize critical services (e.g., HTTP, RDP, SSH).
- [ ]  **Port Enumeration:**
    - Identify services running on open ports.
    - Use tools like **Nmap** with specific scripts for deeper service enumeration.
- [ ]  **Login Panel Identification:** Locate and document login portals for web applications or other services.
- [ ]  **Subdomain Enumeration:** Use tools like **Sublist3r** or **Amass** to identify subdomains and new targets.

---

### **4. Credential Attacks**

- [ ]  **Compile Username List:** Based on OSINT findings, construct a list of potential usernames.
- [ ]  **Password Spraying:** Test common passwords across multiple accounts. Confirm lockout policies with the client first.
- [ ]  **Credential Stuffing:** Use breached credentials with tools like **CredMaster**.
- [ ]  **MFA Bypass Testing:** Attempt to bypass MFA protections using tools like **GraphRunner** or phishing techniques.

---

### **5. Exploitation Phase**

- [ ]  **Analyze Vulnerability Scan Results:** Look for misconfigurations, weak services, or other entry points.
- [ ]  **Attempt Exploits:** Use verified exploits to test for vulnerabilities. Document all attempts and outcomes.
- [ ]  **Privilege Escalation:**
    - Enumerate compromised accounts for privileges.
    - Attempt lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- [ ]  **Data Exfiltration Testing:** Access and document sensitive data (if allowed by RoE).

---

### **6. Post-Exploitation & Reporting**

- [ ]  **Review Compromised Account Access:** Determine permissions and perform further enumeration.
- [ ]  **Document Findings:** Maintain detailed notes for every step, including screenshots and tools used.
- [ ]  **Daily Updates to Client:** Keep the client informed about progress and findings.
- [ ]  **Request Client Account (if needed):** If time-limited, ask the client to provide an account for further testing.
- [ ]  **Compile Report:**
    - Include findings, risks, recommendations, and remediation steps.
    - Deliver a professional and clear report to the client.

---

### **7. Clean-Up**

- [ ]  **Remove Tools & Artifacts:** Ensure no pentesting tools or files remain on the client’s systems.
- [ ]  **Revert Changes:** Restore systems to their original state as agreed in RoE.
