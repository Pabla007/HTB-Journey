Based on **NIST Special Publication 800-115**, hereâ€™s a **checklist** and **methodology** for conducting security testing:

### **Checklist:**

- [ ] **Pre-Engagement Planning**:
    
    - Define scope (assets, networks, applications).
    - Identify goals (vulnerability testing, penetration testing, etc.).
    - Establish rules of engagement (authorized tools, timelines, etc.).
 - [ ] **Information Gathering**:
    
    - Perform network discovery and reconnaissance.
    - Identify system configurations and software.
- [ ] . **Vulnerability Scanning**:
    
    - Use automated tools (e.g., Nessus).
    - Identify known vulnerabilities.
 - [ ] **Penetration Testing**:
    
    - Exploit vulnerabilities.
    - Test escalation paths.
- [ ] . **Reporting**:
    
    - Provide an executive summary and detailed findings.
    - Recommend remediation.

### **Methodology**:

1. **Planning Phase**: Define objectives, scope, and authorization.
2. **Discovery**: Collect data on network topology, systems, and services.
3. **Vulnerability Identification**: Use scanning tools to detect weaknesses.
4. **Exploitation**: Test vulnerabilities by simulating real attacks.
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Assess data access and privilege escalation.
6. **Reporting & Remediation**: Document findings, report risks, and recommend fixes.
