Methodology that i will follow
KISS [i.e. Keep It Simple, Stupid]


Will add the things from EPP later

## Step 1
Information Gathering (i.e. chrome bookmark)
Verify the IP & Identify Targets
Reconnaissance | Passive Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance | Active Reconnaissance (Intrusive):
Web Application Scanning 

IP reconnaissance
- [ ] [Subnettings](https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html)
- [ ] [Verify the IP](https://bgp.he.net/)
- [ ] whois | dnsdumpter | dnsrecon | Robtex



Website Technology Reconnaissance
- [ ] wappalyzer | Built With | whatweb | wayback
- [ ] Scanning aka | Nessus | OpenVAS | Nmap | Nikto | Ping | Xprobe2
- [ ] Google fu https://dorks.faisalahmed.me/
- [ ] run the script in the OSINT VM for subdomains 
- [ ] Sublist3r |  Gobuster | dirbuster | Wfuzz | Amass | httprobe | Subfinder | crt.sh
- [ ] OSINT Bbot | Spider | Shodan | Censys | Maltego 
- [ ] Dehashed
- [ ] Social Media

NEVER TRUST a vulnerability scanner always find it and verify it........


## Step 2

Ports
- 80 > 443 > 139 > 445 are the juiciest of all.

- [ ] Wireshark
- [ ] Msfconsle
- [ ] Buffer Overflow

- [ ] SMB
- [ ] Mounts
SSH 
- [ ] Hydra | Msfconsle (i.e. SSH Brute Force)
- [ ]  fcrackzip
- [ ] Password
```
Credential Stuffing & Password Spraying

What is Credential Stuffing ?
- Injected breached account credentials in hope of account takeover.

Now will see what is Password Spray ??
- It is the ART of using know user-names without a know password (i.e. Will use a default password for all account that could be Fall2022! or Tesla123@)

- So whenever you see a login page always go for Default credentials because you never know..................
