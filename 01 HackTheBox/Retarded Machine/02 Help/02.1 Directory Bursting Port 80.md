Reconnaissance:
As we were not able to find the helpdesk version we google it out and got a github repo
so from there we see a README.md
http://10.10.10.121/support/README.md
we verified the version

Search Exploit:

Will copy the reverse shell script even from the share folder which was new to me.

Will use -m to copy the exploit to help directory
